{"series": "4", "episode": "17", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.", "Sheldon: Buona sera, Luigi\u2019s Pizza. Buona sera. It means good evening in Italian. May I say, having to explain that to you calls into question the authenticity of your ristorante?", "Leonard: Okay, I\u2019m out of here.", "Sheldon: Un momento. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, now you\u2019re being deliberately stupid. (to Leonard) Where are you going?", "Leonard: I\u2019m having dinner with Priya at Raj\u2019s. I think Howard\u2019s going to be there. You want to join us?", "Sheldon: But tonight\u2019s Thursday. On Thursdays, everybody comes over here and has pizza. Or a reasonable facsimile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi, but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan.", "Leonard: Can\u2019t we make a one-time exception for tonight?", "Sheldon: We could. We could also stop using the letter M, but I think that idea is isguided and oronic.", "Leonard: Just come with me to Raj\u2019s.", "Sheldon: Well, I don\u2019t want to go to a party.", "Leonard: It\u2019s not a party. It\u2019s the same group of people who hang out here, hanging out over there.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but five people eating and chatting is a party.", "Leonard: How come it\u2019s not a party when we do it here?", "Sheldon: Because we don\u2019t throw parties.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Sheldon. I\u2019m going to see Priya. Everyone\u2019s over there. You coming or not?", "Sheldon: Well, no, sir, and do you know why? In a word, tradition. Every Thursday night for the last eight years, you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce, discuss the issues of the day, and yes, share a laugh or two. But I guess our rich heritage means nothing to you.", "Leonard: I guess you\u2019re right. See you later.", "Sheldon: Wait! Leonard! Wait! What am I going to do for dinner?", "Leonard: Come with me to Raj\u2019s and eat there.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t do that. What if he serves haggis and blood pudding?", "Leonard: I really doubt that\u2019s what he\u2019ll serve.", "Sheldon: But what if he does? I\u2019ll be obliged to dine on liver and lungs stuffed in a sheep\u2019s stomach. And frankly, blood pudding is essentially the same thing. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s serving both.", "Leonard: What do you want to do? You want to come with me, or do you want to sit here alone?", "Sheldon: No, I\u2019ll go to your haggis party. But I\u2019m telling you, this is adness. This is utter and coplete adness.", "Credits sequence. ", "Sheldon: Oh, dear!", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: Raj\u2019s television. I just realized we\u2019re about to spend an evening watching a plasma screen with a cluster of dead pixels in the upper left-hand corner.", "Leonard: So don\u2019t watch TV. Read a book.", "Sheldon: And be a social pariah? Oh, you know that\u2019s not my style.", "Leonard: Ugh!", "Sheldon: The audible sigh is a show of exasperation, right?", "Leonard: Right.", "Sheldon: Is it about me or the dead pixels?", "Raj: Hey, you\u2019re just in time. We made Tex-Mex.", "Leonard: Oh, sounds great.", "Sheldon: Oh, Indians making Tex-Mex. Might as well have had the Chinese pizza.", "Priya: Hey, you.", "Leonard: Hi.", "Howard: That\u2019s got to be fun for you, huh? Watching Hofstadter suck the saliva out of your sister\u2019s mouth?", "Sheldon: Excuse me. Before this evening goes any further, we need to decide where everyone is going to sit.", "Priya: There is no assigned seats, Sheldon. Just sit anywhere. Make yourself comfortable.", "Sheldon: Oh, what fun. We\u2019re like hippies at a love-in.", "Leonard: Just sit here.", "Sheldon: Yeah, right on, man. Right on. Oh, look, it\u2019s Harry Potter and 98% of The Sorcerer\u2019s Stone.", "Raj: Okay, we\u2019ve got fajitas with all the fixins, so you make your own.", "Sheldon: Wonderful. Dinner, some assembly required.", "Priya: Do you want a margarita, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: A margarita? Where are we? What is happening?", "Scene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory", "Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon. What can I get ya?", "Sheldon: Water. Neat. With a little umbrella.", "Penny: Where are all your friends?", "Sheldon: Sadly, Penny, this evening, I am the Dark Knight, roaming these mean streets alone. A windbreaker for my cape, and a stern expression for my cowl.", "Penny: Okay.", "Sheldon: Excuse me? Isn\u2019t this the point where the world-weary barkeep absentmindedly wipes down the bar and coaxes the woes out of the troubled patron?", "Penny: Well, I was getting your stupid umbrella, but all right. What\u2019s troubling you, buddy?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t think your heart\u2019s in it, but since you asked. Apparently, because Leonard is dating Raj\u2019s sister, we\u2019re all forced to hang out at his apartment.", "Penny: Oh, the horror.", "Sheldon: Indeed. Yeah, at one point, Raj put on reggae music, and his sister took off her shoes. It was like the last days of Caligula. (Phone rings) Oh, I have to get this. Umbrella?", "Penny: Ugh!", "Sheldon: Wonder what she\u2019s exasperated about. Hello?", "Amy (on phone): Sheldon, are you all right? When last we spoke, you were going to take a taxi home from Raj\u2019s, but according to Facebook, you just checked in at the Cheesecake Factory.", "Sheldon: Yes, I was in a taxi, but the driver didn\u2019t look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it.", "Amy: Wise.", "Penny: There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean.", "Amy: Hi, bestie.", "Penny: Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been?", "Amy: Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose.", "Penny: Yeah, it\u2019s a great time to be alive, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t worry. My problems can wait while you two hens finish your clucking.", "Penny: Look, Sheldon, Leonard is dating Priya. She is staying with Raj. That means you\u2019re all probably gonna be hanging out there more.", "Amy: Penny, I\u2019m sorry you got dragged into this. I know you\u2019re devastated that your ex-boyfriend has found an exciting new lover with flawless, caramel-coloured skin.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m not upset about Leonard and Priya.", "Amy: Your flaring nostrils indicate otherwise.", "Sheldon: Cluck-cluck-cluck.", "Amy: Sheldon, look at me. I think it\u2019s time to face the fact that Leonard is the nucleus of your social group. Where he goes, the group goes.", "Sheldon: Leonard the nucleus? That makes no sense. I\u2019m the whimsical elf that everyone looks to for a good time.", "Amy: I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re not fun. You\u2019re the most fun person I know.", "Penny: A lot of people think I\u2019m fun to be around.", "Amy: Don\u2019t be needy, bestie. That\u2019s probably part of what chased Leonard away. What I am saying, Sheldon, is that your group is Leonard-centric. If it were a town, it would be Leonardville. If it were an Islamic nation, Leonardstan. If it were the birthplace of motion pictures, we\u2019d all be singing Hooray for Leonardwood.", "Penny: Ooh, I got one. If you guys were a band, you\u2019d be called Leonard and the Leonards.", "Amy: So needy.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: What you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m setting out snacks.", "Leonard: You do realize everyone\u2019s eating at Raj\u2019s again tonight?", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t say the snacks were for you now, did I, Nosy Rosie?", "Leonard: You\u2019re having people over?", "Sheldon: Yes. Must be killing you wondering who. Fine, I\u2019ll tell you. Stuart from the comic bookstore, Barry Kripke from the university, Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend Zack and TV\u2019s LeVar Burton.", "Leonard: Really? LeVar Burton\u2019s coming here?", "Sheldon: Possibly. I Tweeted him.", "Leonard: Okay, well, tell him I loved him on Star Trek.", "Sheldon: Please, Leonard, stop trying to horn in on my new friends.", "Leonard: Of course. Good night.", "Sheldon: Leonard.", "Leonard: Yeah?", "Sheldon: We had a good run, you and I.", "Leonard: Okay.", "Sheldon: But change is a part of life.", "Leonard: It certainly is.", "Sheldon: Okay. I have guests coming. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave now.", "Leonard: I am leaving.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t make this harder than it is, Leonard.", "Leonard: Good-bye, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: And good-bye to you, sir. He\u2019ll be back.", "Leonard: Of course I\u2019ll be back. I live here!", "Scene: The apartment, later. ", "Sheldon: Well, it would appear LeVar Burton won\u2019t be joining us so let\u2019s get started. Um, I thought we\u2019d begin by going around the room, introducing ourselves and saying a little bit about why we\u2019re here. Okay. I\u2019m Sheldon. Uh, for regular readers of The New England Journal of High Energy Physics, I need no introduction. If you\u2019re not familiar with that publication, there\u2019s a free copy in your goody bag. Stuart?", "Stuart: Um. Hi. I\u2019m Stuart. I run a comic bookstore, which for financial reasons, I\u2019m currently living in. And I guess what I\u2019m hoping for most out of tonight is a hot shower.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s very nice, Stuart. Zack?", "Zack: I\u2019m Zack, and I\u2019m, uh\u2026 uh\u2026 could you come back to me?", "Sheldon: Of course. Barry?", "Barry: I\u2019m Barry Kwipke, and I\u2019m here because you told me there was going to be a whaffle. When is the whaffle?", "Sheldon: Patience, patience, Barry. The whaffle\u2026 the raffle is the grand finale to an evening-long festival of fun and folly.", "Barry: One more question\u2026", "Sheldon: Yes, you must be present to win.", "Zack: Okay, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m Zack, and I\u2019m, uh\u2026 oh, crap, why is this so hard?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Oh, hey.", "Bernadette: Hi.", "Amy: Yo, P-dog.", "Penny: What\u2019s up?", "Bernadette: We\u2019re here to kidnap you for a girls\u2019 night out.", "Amy: Parenthetical, the term kidnap is being used playfully.", "Penny: I kind of figured that.", "Amy: Good. Now put this pillowcase over your head.", "Penny: No.", "Amy: She used to be much more fun, until Leonard punched her in the heart.", "Bernadette: We just thought you might want to go out and have a good time, maybe go dancing.", "Penny: Oh. Gee, thanks, but I\u2019m not really in the mood.", "Amy: You do understand that it will distract you from obsessing over the rich variety of sweet loving that your ex-boyfriend is currently receiving from the fiery jewel of Mumbai.", "Penny: Okay, look, if I agree to go out with you guys, will you promise to stop pestering me about Leonard and Priya?", "Amy: Yes.", "Bernadette: Sure.", "Penny: All right. I\u2019ll go change. Come on in.", "Amy: If you\u2019d have let me bring the chloroform, we wouldn\u2019t have had to put up with all this jibber-jabber.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Zack: Anyway, after we get done snowboarding, I go back to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi. There\u2019s no one around, so naturally, I\u2019m free-balling it. Next thing I know, this beautiful chick shows up, drunk out of her skull, wants to get in with me.", "Sheldon: Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?", "Barry: Weally? That\u2019s your question?", "Zack: What\u2019s the difference?", "Sheldon: Jacuzzi is a commercial brand. Hot tub is the generic term, i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs, but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.", "Zack: Is that like all thumbs are fingers, but not all fingers are thumbs?", "Sheldon: Surprisingly, yes.", "Zack: Nice. Now, what exactly are toes?", "Stuart: Can you please get back to the drunk girl? I\u2019d like something to think about in the shower.", "Zack: Oh, yeah. Right. Anyway, she takes off all of her clothes, climbs into the hot tub, and the first thing I notice\u2026", "Sheldon: The water level rose.", "Zack: No.", "Sheldon: Of course it did. It\u2019s said that Archimedes, the ancient Greek mathematician, discovered the principle of displacement while taking a bath.", "Barry: Tewwific. Go ahead, Zack. Naked dwunk girl, fwee-balling, continue.", "Sheldon: Forgive me, but I think you\u2019ll find my story is more interesting.", "Barry: Does yours have wet bweasts in it?", "Sheldon: Better. It has a gold crown. You see, the king wondered how much gold was in it and charged Archimedes with coming up with the solution. Because the crown was irregularly shaped, there was no way to mathematically determine its volume. But, while bathing, Archimedes realized he could immerse the crown and measure the amount the water rose.", "Zack: So, long story short, I nailed her.", "Sheldon: When he finished, he shouted Eureka!", "Zack: No, I always shout, Holy Moly! Don\u2019t know why. Just do.", "Sheldon: All right, that concludes the getting to know you portion of the evening. Who\u2019s ready to play some vintage video games? And tonight\u2019s selections include ColecoVision\u2019s Smurf Rescue in Gargamel\u2019s Castle, Atari\u2019s Cookie Monster Munch, and for you text adventure aficionados, Zork. Pick me, pick me. I\u2019m fun.", "Barry: That all sucks the big haiwy meatball. How about I go get the kawaoke machine out of my car, get plastered and blow the woof off this place?", "Zack: Great, I\u2019ll make a beer run.", "Stuart: And I\u2019ll take a shower. We\u2019ll meet back here in fifteen.", "Barry: Check.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m unhappy.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: This is delicious. Where\u2019d you learn to make chili?", "Priya: When I was at university in England, my flatmate was from Texas.", "Leonard: I hope she wasn\u2019t anything like my flatmate from Texas.", "Priya: Sheldon is a bit quirky, isn\u2019t he?", "Howard: Oh, please. That crazy bastard\u2019s looking at quirky in the rearview mirror.", "Leonard: Did you know that, per our roommate agreement, I have to wash my feet before I get in the shower? And not in the sink. We each have special buckets.", "Howard: Raj, did you ever tell your sister about the time Sheldon got punched by Bill Gates?", "Priya: Oh, God, you\u2019re kidding.", "Raj: Nope. Gates gave a speech at the university. Sheldon went up to him afterwards and said, maybe if you weren\u2019t so distracted by sick children in Africa, you could have put a little more thought into Windows Vista.\u201d", "Leonard: Bam. Right in the nose. Made me proud to own a PC.", "Raj: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to a rare and wonderful Sheldon-free evening.", "Leonard: Hear, hear.", "Howard: Cheers. You realize that\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever done that without having to listen to Sheldon tell us why it\u2019s called a toast?", "Priya: Why is it called a toast?", "Leonard: Oh, the ancient Romans put spiced toast in their punch bowls.", "Raj: Sheldon tells it better.", "Leonard: He kind of does.", "Howard: Yeah.", "Leonard: Aw, hell, I miss him.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: So, where do you guys want to go dancing?", "Bernadette: We were hoping you\u2019d know a place.", "Amy: Yes, perhaps somewhere packed tightly with young, beautiful bodies sweating and writhing against each other in a glorious orgy of the flesh.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, I know that place. What do you think?", "Amy: That should display enough of your bosom to attract a new mate, or a hungry infant.", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s go through this one more time. Just because Leonard has a new girlfriend does not mean I need to go out and hook up with some guy.", "Bernadette: But you could if you wanted to, right?", "Penny: Well, yeah, I guess.", "Bernadette: Pick out the hottest guy in the room, take him home, do unspeakable things to him, then kick him to the curb with a smile on his face and teeth marks on his heinie?", "Penny: More or less.", "Amy: What\u2019s that like?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s fun while you\u2019re doing it. And then after, it\u2019s mostly embarrassment, self-loathing and regret.", "Bernadette: I would take that deal all day long.", "Penny: Yeah, well, it\u2019s not gonna happen tonight. You know, for the first time in my life, I am not in a relationship, and I\u2019m totally okay with it.", "Amy: You know, if being on your own is new to you, I\u2019d be happy to share some tension-relieving techniques for ladies I\u2019ve perfected over the years. For example, do you have an electric toothbrush?", "Penny: Um, no.", "Amy: You should get one.", "Bernadette: What\u2019s that?", "Amy: It appears to be something preserved between two pieces of acrylic.", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s a snowflake from the North Pole. Leonard gave it to me last year.", "Bernadette: Oh, God, that is so romantic.", "Penny: Yeah, it was.", "Bernadette: Leonard\u2019s really one of a kind.", "Amy: Saying that while holding a snowflake is a little bit heavy-handed, don\u2019t you think?", "Penny: Let me see that. Oh, screw it. I can deal with a little self-loathing. Let\u2019s go find me a heinie to bite.", "Amy: Outstanding. And if we fail, we can always stop at CVS and pick you out a nice toothbrush. I call mine Gerard.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s kind of creepy.", "Scene: The apartment. Barry and Zack are singing \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart\u201d", "\u00a0", "Stuart: Anybody do Walking on Sunshine yet?", "Sheldon: No.", "Stuart: Dibs.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Priya: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon bought a loom and learned how to weave?", "Leonard: He actually got pretty good. He made us all matching serapes.", "Raj: I still wear mine when there\u2019s a nip in the air.", "Priya: Now, was this before or after he adopted the 25 cats?", "Leonard: Long before the cats. I think it was around the time he tried to declare our apartment a sovereign nation. I still have some of the currency.", "Sheldon (outside): (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends. (Knock, knock, knock) All my friends.", "Howard: I think it\u2019s like Beetlejuice. We said his name too many times.", "Raj: Come on in.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Leonard: Hey. I thought you were with your new buddies.", "Sheldon: I had to leave. They were having fun wrong.", "Priya: Come here, Sheldon. Sit here with me.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Priya: Would you like some homemade chili?", "Sheldon: Are there beans in it?", "Priya: Yes.", "Sheldon: Then it\u2019s not chili. Real chili has no beans in it, but you\u2019re from a foreign land, so your ignorance is forgiven.", "Priya: Sheldon, do you want some or not?", "Sheldon: Yes, please. Your girlfriend\u2019s a little short-tempered.", "Raj: I\u2019d like to propose a toast to friends, no matter how quirky.", "All: Cheers.", "Sheldon: Priya, do you know why this is called a toast?", "Priya: Actually, I do. I believe the Romans used to put spiced toast in their punch bowls.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s also a bit of a know-it-all. Mmm. This is good. Whatever it is.", "Scene: The apartment. Stuart is singing \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d. Barry and Zack are doing backing vocals. ", "\u00a0", "LeVar Burton: Hello? I\u2026 Oh, I don\u2019t think so. I am so done with Twitter."]}
