Breathe into this bag.", "Leonard: What\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: They stole everything, Leonard, everything.", "Policeman: Are you the roommate?", "Leonard: Yeah, Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?", "Policeman: Your friend here called 911 to report a robbery.", "Leonard: Oh, my God, what did they get?", "Sheldon: What didn\u2019t they get? They got my enchanted weapons, my vicious gladiator armour, my wand of untainted power, and all my gold.", "Leonard: You called the police because someone hacked your World of Warcraft account?", "Sheldon: What choice did I have? The mighty Sheldor, level 85 blood elf, hero of the Eastern kingdoms, has been picked clean, like a carcass in the desert sun. Plus, the FBI hung up on me.", "Policeman: Into the bag.", "Sheldon: They took my battle ostrich.", "Leonard: Oh, no, not Glenn?", "Sheldon: Yes, Glenn! The only bird I ever loved.", "Policeman: Good luck, fellas.", "Leonard: Thank you, officer.", "Sheldon: Wait a minute! You\u2019re not going to do anything?", "Policeman: Mr. Cooper, there\u2019s nothing\u2026", "Sheldon: Doctor Cooper.", "Policeman: Seriously?", "Leonard: Not the kind with access to drugs.", "Policeman: Fine. Dr. Cooper. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, but the Pasadena Police Department doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction in Pandora.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s from Avatar, World of Warcraft takes place in Azeroth. Goodness gracious, how are you allowed to carry a gun? Can you at least refer me to a rogue ex-cop?", "Policeman: What?", "Sheldon: You know, one who was drummed off the force because he refused to play by the rules, and now he hires himself out to impose his own brand of rough justice?", "Policeman: No.", "Leonard: Thank you, officer.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s all gone. All gone.", "Leonard: I\u2019m really sorry, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: What kind of world do we live in, where a man would take another man\u2019s battle ostrich?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know.", "Sheldon: This act of aggression must be met with swift and cruel ferocity. It is time to cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.", "Leonard: I\u2019m on it. (On phone) Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is, is Howard there? Okay, thanks. That particular dog of war will have to call you back after his bath.", "Sheldon: See if Raj is done with Pilates.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Three thousand hours. Three thousand hours clicking on that mouse, collecting weapons and gold. It\u2019s almost as if it was a huge waste of time.", "Howard: Whoever did this knew what they were doing. He got in and out of your account in under 15 minutes, transferred all your stuff, and didn\u2019t leave a digital fingerprint.", "Sheldon: Oh! There isn\u2019t enough camomile tea in the world to quell the rage in my heart.", "Raj: Hold on. I\u2019m talking to an orc under the bridge in Thunder Bluff who says if we pay him, he\u2019ll help us track down your things.", "Sheldon: Can we trust him?", "Raj: I should say so, he appears to be a member of the Nigerian royal family.", "Howard: Whoa! Somebody\u2019s auctioning off a jewelled ostrich bridle!", "Sheldon: No. Glenn\u2019s was leather. He was a simple ostrich. Is! Is, I haven\u2019t given up hope.", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: Hey, Penny. We\u2019re kind of in the middle of a crisis, here.", "Penny: Oh, I know. Bernadette told me. Sorry, Sheldon. I know that game meant a lot to you.", "Sheldon: That game? Excuse me, Penny, but Doodle Jump is a game. Angry Birds is a game. World of Warcraft is a massively multi-player online role-playing\u2026 all right, technically it\u2019s a game.", "Raj: Bad news, the Nigerian prince may be a fraud.", "Penny: Okay, well, anyways, I brought you a day-old cheesecake to cheer you up!", "Sheldon: Stale pastry is hollow succour to a man who is bereft of ostrich.", "Penny: Just say thank you.", "Sheldon: I thought I just did.", "Penny: All right. See you later.", "Priya: Oh! Hello.", "Penny: Oh, hi! I was just dropping off a cheesecake to Sheldon. He was robbed of a bunch of imaginary crap that\u2019s useful in a make-believe place.", "Priya: I don\u2019t know what that means.", "Penny: Yeah, well, sadly, I do.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: Did you know last weekend Priya took Leonard rollerblading at the beach? Can you believe that?", "Bernadette: I feel like I\u2019m supposed to say that bitch, but I don\u2019t have enough information.", "Penny: I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place. And he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste, I had to carry him to the water.", "Bernadette: I took Howard to the beach once. He almost burst into flames like a vampire.", "Penny: So what\u2019s the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material? I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend.", "Amy: I think you\u2019re on.", "Bernadette: Oh. That bitch!", "Penny: Want some coffee liqueur on your ice cream?", "Amy: Ah, here\u2019s the alcohol and drug peer pressure Mother warned me about. I was starting to think it was never going to happen. Yes, please.", "Penny: You guys should\u2019ve seen Leonard when I first met him. There was no eye contact. He was either looking up at the ceiling, or down at his shoes.", "Amy: I\u2019m drunk.", "Penny: You know, for the first couple of months, whenever I would take off my bra, he would giggle and say, oh boy, my breast friends.", "Bernadette: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I\u2019m never speaking to Priya again.", "Penny: No, don\u2019t do that. No reason to be mean to her.", "Amy: This may be the alcohol talking, but I believe there is. Are you familiar with the recent study of Tanzanian chimpanzees by Nishida and Hosaka out of Kyoto University?", "Penny: No, but I can name all the Kardashians.", "Amy: Primates, such as ourselves, have a natural instinct to ostracize ill-mannered members of the troop. Bernadette\u2019s urge to shun, scowl or fling her waste at Priya is hard-wired into her DNA.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t have an urge to fling my waste.", "Amy: Believe me, it\u2019s there, we all have it. Hit me with some more booze, and I\u2019ll show you.", "Scene: The apartment", "Howard: All right, here we are, this is the tavern where all the black-market weapon trades go down.", "Raj: I don\u2019t think my character should be in a place like this. Everyone\u2019s undressing her with their eyes.", "Howard: Maybe if you stop dropping your sword and bending over to pick it up.", "Leonard: Okay, what exactly are we looking for?", "Howard: Redheaded troll, goes by the name of Glumly. According to the message boards, if you want to move stolen goods and it\u2019s after school hours, he\u2019s your guy.", "Priya: Leonard, is this going to take much longer? I thought we were going to spend some time together.", "Leonard: Uh, we are. In the meantime, you\u2019re welcome to whip up a quick character and join us.", "Priya: Seriously?", "Leonard: Well, you have to put in a credit card number, but it\u2019s fun.", "Priya: Maybe I should just go home.", "Howard: Our troll just walked in! I got him!", "Leonard: We got him. We\u2019re almost done.", "Howard: So, how do you guys want to play this?", "Sheldon: Be ruthless. You tell him if he doesn\u2019t start talking, we\u2019ll register a complaint with his Internet service provider.", "Raj: Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet from his cable company? He could lose his HBO and all their delightful original programming.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t care! I\u2019m losin\u2019 it, man!", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t we play this smart? Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.", "Priya: Oh, dear Lord.", "Howard: Nah, I think we have to be more subtle.", "Raj: Okay, I see where this is going. Fine, I\u2019ll have sex with him.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not where it was going.", "Raj: Good, because I would hate that.", "Priya: Leonard, you\u2019re busy, let\u2019s talk tomorrow.", "Leonard: Oh, wait. Hang on. Are you upset?", "Priya: No, no, I think it\u2019s sexy to date a boy trapped in a man\u2019s body.", "Leonard: Good, good. I\u2019ll tell you what happens.", "Sheldon: And people think I don\u2019t get sarcasm.", "Scene: The hallway. ", "Amy: Well, well, well. Look who it is.", "Penny: Okay, be nice.", "Priya: Hello.", "Penny: Hi. We\u2019re just heading out for a drink.", "Amy: Because I do that now.", "Bernadette: Count your blessings you\u2019re not a Tanzanian chimp.", "Priya: What?", "Penny: Don\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s had a lot of ice cream. Do you want to join us?", "Priya: Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.", "Amy: Four women walk down the stairs, how many reach the lobby?", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Leonard: Did your sister say anything when you got home last night?", "Raj: Oh, no, don\u2019t put me in the middle of this. I\u2019m not going to be your go-between.", "Leonard: Come on, help me out. Am I in trouble?", "Raj: There\u2019s no reason to worry.", "Leonard: That\u2019s a relief.", "Raj: I\u2019m sure many women in happy relationships spend their nights skyping with their ex-boyfriend Sanjay.", "Howard: Good news, gentlemen, I found our hacker.", "Sheldon: What?", "Leonard: Really?", "Howard: Yeah. No one can hide from me, not Waldo, not Carmen San Diego, not even topless Natalie Portman.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve never said these words before, but good job, Howard!", "Howard: Thanks. Our culprit is one Mr. Todd Zarnecki, 2711 Ocean View Road, Carlsbad, California.", "Sheldon: The name and the address drip with evil.", "Raj: What else do we know about him?", "Howard: Well, quite a bit, actually.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s some loser who lives with his parents.", "Howard: Yes, he does live with his parents. Here\u2019s a Google Earth shot of their house.", "Sheldon: Excellent! It\u2019s in a cul-de-sac. We can box him in.", "Leonard: Hold on, you\u2019re thinking of going there?", "Sheldon: Carlsbad is only a couple of hours away.", "Leonard: Fine. You walk up to the house, knock on the door and demand your stuff back. What if he says no?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve been following the news, Leonard, but there have been some terrific advancements in the field of torture.", "Leonard: No one\u2019s getting tortured.", "Sheldon: Fine, we\u2019ll abide by the Geneva Convention. But ask yourself this, in the course of our lives, how much lunch money has been taken from us? How many kites? How many Scooby-Doo Trapper Keepers?", "Raj: I totally had one of those.", "Sheldon: Of course you did. It was a fun and practical way of organizing your school work. But the bullies took it from us. Well, no more. Tonight, we take back our dignity, our birthright and our pride. What do you say? Who\u2019s with me?", "Raj: I have a hip-hop aerobics class at five, could we go after?", "Sheldon: Sure.", "Howard: Also, tonight\u2019s the Sabbath and my mother and I have a tradition of lighting the candles and", "watching Wheel of Fortune, so If we could leave at eight, we\u2019d still be able to regain our birthright at ten, ten thirty latest.", "Sheldon: Fine. Leonard?", "Leonard: Oh, geez, I don\u2019t know if I can ditch Priya two nights in a row.", "Raj: Oh, come on, man. Bros before\u2026 my sister.", "Leonard: Aw, screw it. I\u2019m in.", "Raj: Me, too.", "Howard: And me.", "Sheldon: One moment. (Places a tissue on their hands before adding his own) I\u2019m hell-bent on catching a cyber criminal, not the common cold.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s house", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I thought this delay was so you could watch Wheel of Fortune with your mother.", "Howard: I am. She\u2019s just bleaching her moustache. Check it out. Hey, Ma! Before and After! Four words, 17 letters, two N\u2019s, one V.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (off): Fanny pack of wolves.", "Leonard: That\u2019s incredible.", "Howard: Yeah, she\u2019s kind of a Wheel savant.", "Leonard (phone rings): Uh-oh, that\u2019s Priya.", "Raj: Sitar music for her ringtone is not cool, dude.", "Leonard: Hit the\u2026 Hey, sweetie. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m gonna be working late. I, I, I miss you, too. Okay, sure, I\u2019ll call you when I get home. Okay, bye-bye.", "Raj: Very nice. You lie to my sister.", "Howard: That\u2019s the nicest thing he does to your sister.", "Raj (phone rings): Oh, guess who.", "Leonard: Cover for me.", "Raj: Hello, Priya. What\u2019s up? How would I know if Leonard\u2019s at work or not? Don\u2019t be suspicious. Look, if you want your relationship with Leonard to continue, you\u2019re going to have to believe whatever wild-eyed, cockamamie excuse the white devil has the nerve to offer you. Okay? Yeah, bye-bye. You owe me.", "Howard: New puzzle, Ma. Same name. One N, two D\u2019s, three O\u2019s.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (off): Whoopi and Rube Goldberg!", "Sheldon: That\u2019s uncanny.", "Howard: I know. It\u2019s her superpower. Well, that and jiggling her arm fat.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car. ", "Leonard: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re going all the way to San Diego to confront this guy.", "Howard: Yeah, we\u2019re kind of bad-asses, aren\u2019t we?", "Leonard: Totally.", "Raj: Hey, how about we stay the night and hit Legoland in the morning?", "Sheldon: Sea World is better. It has Shamu, who is literally tons of fun. But for the moment, let\u2019s stay focused on Todd Zarnecki.", "Raj: Yeah, we\u2019re coming for you, Todd Zarnecki. And for the record, Legoland is more interactive.", "Sheldon: I almost feel sorry for the poor fool, sitting in his split-level suburban ranch, unaware that a vengeful horde is barrelling down the San Diego Freeway at 71 miles an hour. Ease up there, lead foot. You trying to get us killed?", "Raj: I took the liberty of burning us a mix of heroic questing music.", "Sheldon: This says Beyonce Bootylicious Dance Mix.", "Raj: It\u2019s a re-writable CD. Just put it in.", "Howard: Beyonce? Really?", "Raj: She\u2019s curvy and she owns it. I like that.", "Leonard (as Ride of the Valkyries begins): Oh, yeah, I\u2019m feeling it.", "Sheldon: We are winged fury! Which is still no excuse for going over the posted speed limit.", "Scene: Stuck in a traffic tailback.", "Howard: Next time we go to kick someone\u2019s ass, we take the train.", "Sheldon: I always prefer the train.", "Scene: Outside Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house.", "Leonard: Sheldon, let\u2019s go.", "Sheldon: Coming.", "Howard: Why did you bring that?", "Sheldon: No weapon strikes more fear into a man\u2019s heart than a Klingon bat\u2019leth.", "Leonard: Okay, let\u2019s get clear on something. We\u2019re just going to tell this guy to transfer all of your stuff back into your account and then be on our way. No one\u2019s bat\u2019lething anybody.", "Sheldon: So my blade shall not taste blood tonight?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Well, now I just feel silly holding it.", "Leonard: Come on.", "Sheldon: Can I at least kick down the door?", "Leonard: You\u2019re welcome to try, but the other day, it took you 15 minutes to get into a FedEx box. (Rings bell)", "Voice Inside: Who is it?", "Sheldon: Your doom!", "Raj: Don\u2019t say your doom. Who opens the door for their doom?", "Sheldon: Good point. Basket of puppies.", "Huge man (opening door): What?", "Leonard: Uh, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Are you Todd Zarnecki?", "Todd: Yeah. Who are you?", "Sheldon: I am Sheldor of Azeroth. I want my things back.", "Todd: I don\u2019t think so. Let me see that.", "Sheldon: Careful. That\u2019s a collectible.", "Todd: I know. I\u2019ve always wanted one. (Closes door)", "Sheldon: Well, he\u2019s even more cunning than we thought.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: You know, the joke\u2019s on him. Without the certificate of authenticity, that bat\u2019leth is worthless.", "Howard: Yeah, he walked right into our trap.", "Raj: Legoland seems like a hollow dream now.", "Leonard: Oh-oh.", "Raj: What\u2019s the matter?", "Leonard: Something\u2019s wrong, I\u2019m not getting any gas. Anybody know anything about internal combustion engines?", "Sheldon: Of course.", "Raj: Very basic.", "Howard: 19th-century technology.", "Leonard: Does anybody know how to fix an internal combustion engine?", "Sheldon: No.", "Howard: No, not a clue.", "Leonard: Well, we\u2019d better call somebody to come pick us up.", "Sheldon: It\u2019d be swell if they had a train.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.", "Penny: No problem. So, Leonard, I think it\u2019s interesting you didn\u2019t call your girlfriend to come get you.", "Leonard: Uh, I kind of told her I was working.", "Penny: So you lied to her. Also interesting.", "Leonard: Yeah, she doesn\u2019t really understand the whole Warcraft adventure-role-playing thing.", "Penny: Well, doesn\u2019t matter if she gets it, as long as she\u2019s pretty.", "Howard: This one\u2019s funny, Leonard. How come you couldn\u2019t make it work with her?", "Penny: So did you at least get Sheldon\u2019s fake stuff back?", "Sheldon: No. We failed in our noble quest.", "Penny: How come?", "Sheldon: Todd Zarnecki was mean.", "Penny: All right. Hang on.", "Leonard: What are you doing?", "Penny: I\u2019m gonna show you how we finish a quest in Nebraska. Oh. Beyonce. (Ride of the Valkyries) This ain\u2019t no Beyonce.", "Scene: Todd Zarnecki\u2019s house. Todd answers the door. ", "Todd: Now what?", "Penny: Give my friend his stuff back.", "Todd: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.", "Penny: Well, then, good news. Today\u2019s the day a girl\u2019s finally going to touch you in your little special place. (Kicks him in the groin) Now give him his stuff back.", "Todd: Okay.", "Sheldon: We did it! I said, we.", "Scene: The lobby. ", "Priya: Oh, hold the door.", "Penny: Oh, hi.", "Priya: Hi.", "Penny: Going to see Leonard?", "Priya: Yes. How have you been?", "Penny: Fine. You?", "Priya: Very well, thank you.", "(They ascend all three flights of stairs in silence.)", "Penny: Alright, well great seeing you.", "Priya: Yeah, you too.", "Penny: Amy\u2019s right. I do want to fling my poop at her."]}
