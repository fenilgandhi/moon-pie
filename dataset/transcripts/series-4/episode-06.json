I mean it tastes like it was made of actual ground-up shoemaker.", "Sheldon: Amusing. A play on the two meanings of cobbler.", "Raj: Hey guys, guess who I found at LAX. My baby sister Priya.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. I object. You propose a guessing game, yet you don\u2019t give me enough time to guess. For the record, I was going to say your sister Priya.", "Priya: Oh, Sheldon. You haven\u2019t changed a bit, have you?", "Sheldon: Why would I change?", "Leonard: The hope has been that you\u2019d eventually bend to public opinion. So, Priya, what brings you back to LA?", "Priya: I have a one day layover on my way to Toronto. Corporate merger.", "Raj: Can you believe it? Little Priya\u2019s one of the lead attorneys for the biggest car company in India.", "Sheldon: Given that when we met her she was finishing law school and planning an internship at a large Indian car company, it\u2019s actually extremely plausible.", "Leonard: And your poll numbers just keep dropping.", "Priya: I want to catch up with all of you, but first I really must visit the loo.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going too, I\u2019ll show you where it is.", "Raj: Alright, this goes without saying, but I\u2019m just going to say it anyway. Hands off my sister.", "Sheldon: Why would I touch her, she\u2019s covered with airplane germs.", "Raj: I\u2019m so not talking to you. I\u2019m talking to him.", "Howard: Hey, I\u2019ve got a girlfriend now.", "Raj: Oh please. My sister\u2019s much hotter than your girlfriend and you know it.", "Howard: Let\u2019s just agree they\u2019re both hot.", "Raj: Dude, that\u2019s my sister you\u2019re talking about.", "Howard: Okay, forget who\u2019s hotter. The first time Priya came to LA, Leonard and I made a pact out of respect to our friendship, and to you, that neither of us would hit on her.", "Raj: Did you pinky swear?", "Howard: Yes.", "Raj: Okay then.", "Sheldon: Cobbler. I\u2019m still laughing.", "Scene: A corridor.", "\u00a0", "Priya: It\u2019s really nice to see you again Leonard.", "Leonard: Yeah. It\u2019s good to see you too. Here you go.", "Priya: Thanks.

Okay.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "\u00a0", "Howard: So, you got any special plans with your sister?", "Raj: Oh, not really, just hang out.", "Sheldon: I always tell people, if you have only one day in Los Angeles, make it a train day.", "Raj: Train day?", "Sheldon: The fun starts with brunch at Carney\u2019s in Studio City, a hot dog stand in a converted railroad dining car. Next stop, Travel Town, an outdoor museum featuring 43 railroad engines, cars and other rolling stock from the 1880s to the 1930s. Finally, we\u2019re off to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood for dinner at, that\u2019s right, the Hollywood Carney\u2019s, a hot dog stand in a different converted railroad dining car.", "Raj: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to do that.", "Sheldon: Well then apparently, you hate fun.", "Leonard: Hmm, Priya\u2019s not back yet? Well, I guess that\u2019s not unusual, women, men, the whole sitting, standing deal, so, what are we talking about?", "Raj: Uh, my plans with Priya.", "Sheldon: He rejected train day.", "Leonard: Did you make it clear that it\u2019s two different train cars turned into hot dog stands?", "Sheldon: Abundantly.", "Leonard: I guess he just hates fun.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s what I said.", "Priya: Okay, so, what\u2019s new with you guys.", "Howard: I have a girlfriend now.", "Priya: Hey, good for you.", "Howard: Yeah, I just wanna put it out there in case I inadvertently squirt any pheromones in your direction. Happy? (Raj nods).

Sheldon is on his laptop.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: You are in a forest. There is quicksand to the west, a path leads to the east. Go east. An iron gate blocks your way. Open gate. It\u2019s locked. Hmm, well, so much for that.", "Leonard: It\u2019s getting pretty late, how come you\u2019re still up?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve found an emulator online that lets you play classic text based computer games from the 1980s.", "Leonard: That\u2019s pretty cool.", "Sheldon: Oh yes. It runs on the world\u2019s most powerful graphics chip, imagination.", "Leonard: You\u2019ve really got to get out more.", "Sheldon: Go north. You can\u2019t go that way. Go west. A troll blocks your passage. Okay, fasten your seatbelts, kill troll. With what? With sword. (There is a knock on the door.) You don\u2019t have the sword. Good golly, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s actually happening to me.", "Priya (at door): Raj finally went to bed.", "Leonard: Yeah, well, (kissing her) Sheldon\u2019s still up.", "Priya: You said he goes to bed at nine.", "Leonard: Yeah, he does but he got caught up in a computer game and\u2026", "Sheldon: Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Hit troll with axe. Oh my, this is one tough troll.", "Priya: Can\u2019t you get rid of him?", "Leonard: If the past is any indication, no.", "Sheldon: Leonard, I\u2019m trapped in quicksand, the axe is dragging me down.", "Leonard: Drop axe.", "Sheldon: Drop axe. Brilliant.", "Leonard: Give me a minute. Sheldon,", "Sheldon: Hold on. I have to figure out how to get the bucket, so I can carry the mud past the dragon.", "Leonard: Sheldon, you need to work in the morning.", "Sheldon: I know.", "Leonard: Well then, bed mister.", "Sheldon: Five more minutes.", "Leonard: Really? You\u2019re going to risk getting sleepy in the middle of your thermodynamic fluctuations seminar? You know what happens when you yawn in public.", "Sheldon: Everyone will see my oddly shaped uvula.", "Leonard: You don\u2019t want that, do you?", "Sheldon: No. But it\u2019s a shame our society mocks the differently uvulated. Who was at the door?", "Leonard: Oh, uh, building manager. They have to fix a pipe so the water will be off tomorrow from noon to two.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s unacceptable. We\u2019re supposed to be given written notice.", "Leonard: No, no, it doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019ll be at work.", "Sheldon: Well, what if I spill tomato soup on my shirt and have to come home to change, only to find there\u2019s no water for an enzyme soak.", "Leonard: Bifurcated uvula, Sheldon!", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll have the chicken noodle. Goodnight.", "Leonard (to Priya): We\u2019re going to have to be very quiet.", "Sheldon: I know how to get the bucket! I can turn the axe around and use the handle to reach it. Let\u2019s see. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Go north. You are in a forest. Oh dear, I believe I\u2019m lost. Well, I\u2019ll just have to get a fresh start tomorrow.", "Leonard: No, no, no, no, no. You just need, you just need, you just need to map it out. Come on, I\u2019ll help you. So, uh, you stopped at the stream and you turned north three times?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right, you\u2019re lost, good luck.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Morning. ", "\u00a0", "Priya: Oh! Leonard, wake up.", "Leonard: Huh! Sorry!", "Priya: For what?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. When I\u2019m in bed with a girl, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s my go to response.", "Priya: It\u2019s six o\u2019 clock, I have to get back to Raj\u2019s before he wakes up and realises I\u2019m gone.", "Leonard: Oh, right, sure. I wish you could stay in LA a while longer.", "Priya: Mmm. Me too.", "Leonard: You know, I was thinking, there are some great research facilities in India.", "Priya: Where are you going with this, Leonard?", "Leonard: Well, I\u2019m just saying, I don\u2019t have any real ties here, so if I were to move to New Delhi we could, you know, go out.", "Priya: Leonard, didn\u2019t we have this conversation five years ago.", "Leonard: Well, yes, but, things have changed, you know, you\u2019re older, I\u2019m older. Look, no more superhero bedsheets.", "Priya: Sweetheart, just because we have fun when I come to town doesn\u2019t mean I want to have a serious relationship.", "Leonard: It doesn\u2019t?", "Priya: Mm-mm. And besides, I could never bring a white boy home to my parents. They\u2019d have a cow. Which is a much bigger deal in India.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not that white. My great-great grandmother was half Cherokee. I know that\u2019s not the right kind of Indian but it is something.", "Priya: Aha, you\u2019re funny.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: I heard a woman laughing.", "Leonard: Oh, uh, yeah, I was trying to see if I could laugh as a woman.", "Sheldon: Oh. Well, good job, quite convincing. I smell perfume.", "Leonard: Air freshener.", "Sheldon: And is that lipstick on your cheek and neck.", "Leonard: Uh, rash, that\u2019s a bad rash.", "Sheldon: My sympathies. I am no stranger to the crimson scourge that is dermatitis. Can I interest you in a topical steroid from my lotion and unguent collection?", "Leonard: Uh, yeah, yeah, that sounds great.", "Sheldon: Very well, I\u2019m sure I can find something that will help you ditch that itch.", "Leonard: Okay, he\u2019s in the bathroom, let\u2019s go.", "Sheldon: Do you prefer ointment or cream?", "Leonard: Uh, cream.", "Sheldon: With or without a numbing agent?", "Leonard: Without.", "Sheldon: Really? Leonard, there are no heroes when it comes to dermatitis.", "Leonard: Fine. With.", "Sheldon: Prescription or non-prescription strength.", "Leonard: Use your best judgement.", "Sheldon: Well, I think I have a nice 2009 AnaMantle HC. It\u2019s usually indicated for acutely inflamed haemorrhoids, but it also goes nicely with non mucosal body parts.", "Leonard: Sounds great.", "Sheldon: Excellent choice.", "Leonard (whispering): Right, right, alright. (They creep almost to the apartment door.)", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Priya?", "Priya: Good morning, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: For shame, Leonard. For shame. And to think I was ready to waste the last of my good haemorrhoid cream on you.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car. ", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Making pretty good time, huh?", "Sheldon: Is that really what you want to talk about, Leonard?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: What do you want to talk about?", "Leonard: Please don\u2019t tell anyone I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister.", "Sheldon: There it is. What if someone asks?", "Leonard: No-one\u2019s going to ask if I spent the night with Raj\u2019s sister.", "Sheldon: Perhaps. But they might ask me something else.", "Leonard: Like what?", "Sheldon: Like, has Leonard betrayed any of his friends recently?", "Leonard: Priya and I are both adults. We didn\u2019t betray Raj.", "Sheldon: In fact, you did, but I was referring to Howard.", "Leonard: What are you talking about?", "Sheldon: April 12th, 2005, Bob\u2019s Big Boy, Toluca Lake. Raj had just introduced us to Priya for the first time, and she was enjoying the sweet taste of Hindu rebellion in the form of a Bob\u2019s Super Big Boy hamburger. In order to preserve your friendship, you and Howard made a pinky swear that neither of you would attempt to woo her. I had a patty melt.", "Leonard: Okay, fine, I betrayed Howard.", "Sheldon: And Raj.", "Leonard: Alright, and Raj.", "Sheldon: And me.", "Leonard: You?", "Sheldon: Violation of the roommate agreement, overnight guest notification clause.", "Leonard: Okay fine, I\u2019m, I\u2019m a horrible human being, I\u2019m the Darth Vader of Pasadena.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re far too short to be Darth Vader. At best you might be a turncoat Ewok.", "Leonard: My point is, Priya\u2019s gone. And it would be much better if no-one else found out about this.", "Sheldon: You mean, you want me to keep a secret.", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: You know I can\u2019t keep a secret.", "Leonard: You can if you try. Think about it this way, if I were Batman and you were Alfred, you\u2019d keep that secret. Right?", "Sheldon: Why do you get to be Batman?", "Leonard: Because, well, Batman has the secret.", "Sheldon: Well Alfred has secrets too.", "Leonard: Like what?", "Sheldon: Alfred knows that Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Which I\u2019ve now just told to Batman. See, I can\u2019t keep a secret.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s lab.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Ta-da!", "Leonard: What.", "Sheldon: Ta-da. It\u2019s short for da-da-da-da!", "Leonard: Kind of busy here, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I know, that\u2019s why I shortened it.", "Leonard: What do you want.", "Sheldon: I came to go over your alibi for last night.", "Leonard: What alibi?", "Sheldon: You\u2019ve asked me to lie on your behalf, and as you know, I am deeply uncomfortable with impromptu dishonest, so I\u2019ve provided you with an iron clad alibi. You couldn\u2019t have spent last night with Priya, because you were with another woman.", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019m so sure I\u2019m going to regret this, but, who was I with?", "Sheldon: The fun loving, and morally loose, Miss Maggie McGeary.", "Leonard: Oh, God.", "Sheldon: You met her at Pasadena\u2019s most popular Irish watering hole, Lucky Baldwin\u2019s, where Maggie spends her nights tending bar, with a head full of curls and a heart full of dreams.", "Leonard (reading a napkin Sheldon has handed him): Leonard, call me if you\u2019re interested in coitus. Sincerely, Maggie McGeary.", "Sheldon: And if anyone were to actually call that number they will hear this.", "Mechanical voice on Sheldon\u2019s phone: Top of the morning to you. You\u2019ve reached Maggie McGeary. Leave a message after the wee little beep.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s pretty convincing, huh? And it wasn\u2019t even a real person. And here is the clincher. A lock of Maggie\u2019s flaming auburn hair.", "Leonard: Where did you get that?", "Sheldon: From an orang-u-tan in the primate lab.", "Leonard: An orang-u-tan?", "Sheldon: Well, no-one\u2019s going to run a DNA test on it, Leonard, honestly you over-think everything.", "Leonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t need an alibi. Nobody\u2019s going to ask about last night as long as you just zip your lip. (Sheldon makes lip zipping movement.) Thankyou. Now don\u2019t worry, everything is going to be fine. (Sheldon writes \u201cI doubt it\u201d on Leonard\u2019s whiteboard.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Hey.", "Raj: Hey, Leonard, will you please tell Howard my sister\u2019s never been attracted to him.", "Leonard: C\u2019mon Raj, how am I supposed to know who she\u2019s attracted to. Or was attracted to. Or who she might be attracted to. In the future.", "Sheldon: And I have nothing to contribute to this conversation. Because I too know absolutely nothing about Priya\u2019s preferences in male companionship. And with that, I will re-zip my lip.", "Raj: Hey, so what did you guys think of the new episode of Caprica last night?", "Leonard: I didn\u2019t see it.", "Howard: Didn\u2019t see it? What were you doing?", "Leonard: Uh, I was out.", "Raj: On Caprica night?", "Leonard: Yeah, I, uh, went for a drink.", "Howard: Really, you, and where, where did you go?", "Leonard: To, uh, Lucky Baldwin\u2019s.", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019ve heard of that place, isn\u2019t that Pasadena\u2019s favourite Irish watering hole.", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: Did you meet anyone interesting there, perhaps a promiscuous redheaded barmaid?", "Leonard: As a matter of fact I.. I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t do it.", "Sheldon: Sure you can, you\u2019re doing fine, it\u2019s very believable.", "Leonard: Look, I\u2019m sorry Raj, but the truth is I was with Priya last night.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t listen to him, he\u2019s still light headed from all the Irish whiskey and pickled eggs in his system.", "Raj: What were you doing with Priya?", "Sheldon: I believe they engaged in coitus but, more importantly, if Leonard had not abandoned his story, would you have found it plausible?", "Raj: What? You slept with my sister?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: How could you? We had a pact!", "Raj: Excuse me, I think how could you she\u2019s my sister takes precedence over a five year old pinky swear!", "Sheldon: May I point out, in a parallel universe, your friends are saying Maggie McGeary, she sounds lovely.", "Leonard: Look, I admit it, I may have crossed a line here, but come on, Raj, your sister is a grown woman. To her, I\u2019m a forbidden piece of white chocolate.", "Raj: I\u2026 I don\u2019t believe it, this is a terrible betrayal of my trust.", "Leonard: No, no, no, would it help if I told you that I offered her my heart and she kind of stomped on it.", "Raj: How hard did she stomp?", "Leonard: Very hard.", "Raj: Okay, I\u2019m good.", "Howard: Yeah, well, Raj, I just want to say that I\u2019d never betray your trust. Unlike Leonard, I respect you.", "Leonard: Really?", "Howard: Mmm.", "Leonard: Was it out of respect that you didn\u2019t tell Raj about the time you dropped his iPhone in a urinal?", "Raj: Dude! I put that thing on my face!", "Sheldon: I think a more amusing violation of Raj\u2019s trust is when Howard convinced him that foreigners give presents to Americans on Thanksgiving.", "Howard: Hey, I didn\u2019t see you giving back your Snoopy snowcone maker.", "Raj: That was all a lie? This year\u2019s gifts are already wrapped!", "Howard: And as long as we\u2019re talking about betraying our friends, how about the month Sheldon spent grinding up insects and mixing them into Leonard\u2019s food.", "Sheldon: Well, excuse me. That was not a betrayal, that was an experiment to determine at what concentration food starts tasting mothy.", "Leonard: You put moths in my food?", "Sheldon: For science.", "Raj: I can\u2019t believe you kissed my sister with moth mouth.", "Leonard: Well, uh, I can\u2019t believe you used Sheldon\u2019s toothbrush.", "Sheldon: You used my toothbrush?", "Raj: Not the brush part, just the little rubber thing to pick food from my teeth and massage my gums.", "Leonard: Okay, I, I, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019ve all done some things we\u2019re not particularly proud of. But come on, we\u2019re friends. Friends overlook each other\u2019s minor lapses. For the record, Howard, I\u2019m sorry that I broke our pact.", "Howard: Thankyou, and I\u2019m sorry about your phone. And Thanksgiving. And while we\u2019re at it, you don\u2019t have to wash our clothes on the fourth of July.", "Raj: As long as we\u2019re apologising, Sheldon, I, I\u2019m sorry I used your toothbrush.", "Sheldon: And I\u2019m sorry. But that behaviour is beyond the pale and cannot be tolerated. We are no longer friends.", "Raj: I got you a talking Thomas the Tank Engine for Thanksgiving.", "Sheldon: With real puffing smoke?", "Raj: Yes.", "Sheldon: Alright. But I\u2019m watching you.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is making snowcones.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Hey, you got Snoopy out. Can I have a snowcone?", "Sheldon: Well, sure.", "Leonard: These are pretty god, what flavour is this?", "Sheldon: Guess.", "Leonard: Papaya?", "Sheldon: No.", "Leonard: Guava?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re so close.", "Leonard: I give up.", "Sheldon: Mango, caterpillar. What are you doing? You said you liked it!"]}
