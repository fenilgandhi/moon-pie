{"series": "4", "episode": "14", "transcript": ["Scene: A lecture hall.", "Sheldon: Good evening. I\u2019m your guest lecturer, Dr. Sheldon Cooper. I was expecting applause, but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate. I agreed to speak to you this evening, because I was told that you\u2019re the best and the brightest of this university\u2019s doctoral candidates. Hmm. Of course, that\u2019s like saying you are the most important electron in a hydrogen atom. \u2018Cause, you see, there\u2019s only one electron in a hydrogen atom. Best and brightest, my sweet patootie. All right, let\u2019s begin. Show of hands, who here is familiar with the concept of topological insulators? Don\u2019t kid yourselves.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: I found another tweet from a student at Sheldon\u2019s lecture. Dr. Cooper has taken a relatively boring subject and managed to make it completely insufferable. Plus, he looks like a giant insect.", "Howard: Look. Listen to this one. Does Einstein\u2019s theory explain why time flies when you\u2019re having fun, but when you\u2019re listening to Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky, dead?", "Raj: Ooh, somebody took pictures and uploaded them to their Flickr account.", "Leonard: Wow. How do you get an entire lecture hall to flip you off at the same time?", "Howard: Apparently, if you\u2019re Sheldon, all you need to do is turn your back.", "Penny: Hey, Leonard, is your wi-fi down? I can\u2019t get on.", "Leonard: Oh, Sheldon changed the password. It\u2019s now Penny is a freeloader. No spaces.", "Penny: Thanks. What are you guys doing?", "Leonard: Sheldon gave a lecture at the university tonight. We\u2019re reading the reviews.", "Penny: Oh. How\u2019d he do?", "Howard: Well, picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.", "Penny: That bad, huh?", "Leonard: Read this woman\u2019s tweet.", "Penny: Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me want to start cutting myself again", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Good evening, Leonard, Howard, Raj, freeloader.", "Howard: So, how\u2019d the lecture go?", "Leonard: In a word, triumphant.", "Leonard: Really? Triumphant?", "Sheldon: Oh, yes, you should have seen those young people. Thirsty for knowledge, drinking in my wisdom. I may have changed a few lives today.", "Penny: Oh, please let me tell him.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, I kind of promised Howard.", "Sheldon: Tell me what?", "Howard: Actually, we should all share the moment. Raj, if you would.", "Sheldon: Oh, tweets about my lecture. Hmm. That\u2019s rather unfair. That\u2019s downright cruel. Plus, insects have six legs. Yeah, I\u2019m not familiar with the acronym KMN.", "Leonard: Oh, uh, from the context, we think it means kill me now.", "Sheldon: Well, I suppose everyone\u2019s entitled to their own opinion. I think I\u2019ll turn in. I didn\u2019t want to teach those poopy heads, anyway.", "Howard: FYI, I think that\u2019s what Darth Vader said just before he started building the Death Star.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory", "Howard: Sheldon still moping?", "Leonard: Yeah, it\u2019s weird. Even though he didn\u2019t want to give the lecture in the first place, being rejected by those students really hit him hard.", "Raj: Mmm, I know the feeling. It\u2019s like accidentally walking into a gay bar and then having no one hit on you. It-It happened to a friend of mine.", "Bernadette: Are you guys doing okay?", "Howard: Yeah, Leonard and I are fine, but I think Raj needs to meet a girl really soon.", "Bernadette: Well, that shouldn\u2019t be too hard. He\u2019s such a cutie.", "Raj: Thank you, but cute is for bunnies. I want to be something with sex appeal, like, like a labradoodle.", "Howard: Labradoodle?", "Leonard: We might be starting to zero in on your problem.", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t you listen to them. You\u2019ve got plenty of sex appeal.", "Raj: You really think so?", "Bernadette: Yeah. You\u2019re a hottie.", "Raj: Well, thanks, Bernadette. And just for the record, labradoodles are hypo-allergenic, which is a very sexy quality to those troubled by animal dander.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy (on webcam, with an undersea background): So, what do you think?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a charming illusion, but it does not cheer me up.", "Amy: Not even when I do this? (Pretends to be a fish)", "Sheldon: No.", "Amy: Well, that was the last arrow in my quiver of whimsy.", "Sheldon: Do you realize that teaching is the first thing I\u2019ve failed at since my ill-fated attempt to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?", "Amy: If this humiliating experience is really troubling you, there are things we could do about it.", "Sheldon: For instance?", "Amy: Well, the first thing that comes to mind is isolating the part of your brain where the memory is stored and destroying it with a laser.", "Sheldon: Hmm, no. One slip of the hand, and suddenly I\u2019m sitting in the Engineering Department, building doodads with Wolowitz.", "Amy: All right. Have you considered improving your socialization skills, thus allowing you to communicate more effectively with other people?", "Sheldon: Isn\u2019t that their burden? I\u2019m the one with something interesting to say.", "Amy: Fair enough, but in its essence, teaching is a performance art. In the classroom paradigm, the teacher has the responsibility to communicate, as well as entertain and engage.", "Sheldon: I sense that you\u2019re trying to slow-walk me to an epiphany. Would you mind very much jumping to it?", "Amy: Perhaps you should consider taking acting lessons.", "Sheldon: Acting lessons. Interesting. It might help if I could act as though I care about my students and whether or not they learn.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re an (finger quotes) actress, correct?", "Penny: I\u2019m not an (finger quotes)actress. I\u2019m an actress.", "Sheldon: All right. You\u2019re an actress. I need you to teach me.", "Penny: You want an acting lesson?", "Sheldon: Perhaps two. I\u2019d like to master the craft.", "Penny: Okay, where is this coming from?", "Sheldon: It has been suggested to me that acting techniques could improve my lecturing, at which, if certain tweets and blogs are to be believed, I suck the big one.", "Penny: Yeah, I saw those. They were funny. I printed a few out and put \u2019em on my fridge.", "Sheldon: So, when could we start?", "Penny: Okay, just to be clear. You are asking me for help because I know something that the brilliant Dr. Sheldon Cooper doesn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: I suppose that\u2019s one way to look at it.", "Penny: I think it\u2019s the only way to look at it.", "Sheldon: Are you going to help me or not?", "Penny: Probably. I\u2019m just enjoying the foreplay. Does this mean you are done mocking my acting career?", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, I thought making the transition from actor to acting teacher was the signal that one\u2019s career had reached the end of the road.", "Penny: Forget it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll pay you 40 dollars.", "Penny: Saturday, nine a.m. Bring cash.", "Scene: The university cafeteria", "Howard: Raj, I have amazing news!", "Raj: What?", "Howard: I just got offered a fellowship at the Weitzmann Institute in Israel.", "Raj: Dude, that\u2019s incredible!", "Howard: I know. The only thing is, I\u2019m gonna be gone for two years.", "Raj: Aw, I\u2019m gonna miss you. Are you going with him?", "Bernadette: I have to stay here for school.", "Howard: That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to talk to you about. You see, Bernadette has needs.", "Raj: What kind of needs?", "Howard: Sexual needs.", "Bernadette: Most of them regular, some of them kind of messed up.", "Howard: So, while I\u2019m gone, you\u2019re going to have to satisfy her.", "Bernadette: What do you say?", "Raj: I say okey-dokey.", "Howard (to the real Raj who is daydreaming): What ya thinking so hard about?", "Raj: Just that I\u2019m definitely not gay.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: What\u2019s wrong?", "Sheldon: Nothing. I was acting.", "Penny: You were acting?", "Sheldon: Yes. In preparation for today\u2019s studies, I read Stanislavski\u2019s An Actor Prepares, Stella Adler\u2019s", "The Technique of Acting, Uta Hagen\u2019s Respect for Acting, and Henry Winkler\u2019s Heyyy, I\u2019m an Actor.", "Penny: Well, good for you. Come on in.", "Sheldon: How shall we begin?", "Penny: Well, I thought we\u2019d start with some basic movement exercises. You know, get our bodies warmed up a little.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: So I just want you to relax and kind of move around in the space. You know, just do whatever feels natural. Sheldon?", "Sheldon (doing nothing): You said to do whatever feels natural. This feels natural. Certainly more natural than what you\u2019re doing.", "Penny: Come on, you got to work with me. We need to get connected with our bodies.", "Sheldon: Penny, my body and I have a relationship that works best when we maintain a cool, wary distance from each other.", "Penny: All right, let\u2019s just say we\u2019ve warmed up.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re the teacher.", "Penny: Okay. One of the things that might help you in connecting with your students is being a little more spontaneous. So why don\u2019t we try some improvisation?", "Sheldon: Why not? It seems like you\u2019re improvising your entire curriculum.", "Penny: This is all about listening and responding.", "Sheldon: Gotcha.", "Penny: I\u2019m going to create a character and a situation, and you just jump in when you feel it.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: All right.", "Sheldon: Action.", "Penny: Okay, it\u2019s not a movie. It\u2019s improv. So no one calls action.", "Sheldon: Hey, you taught me something. Who would have thought it?", "Penny: Okay. Uh, no, the shipment has not arrived, and I really need those shoes. They are my biggest seller. Yes, ladies sizes six through ten. Thank you. Oh, sorry, I have to go, I have a customer. Bye-bye. Hi. Can I help you?", "Sheldon: I\u2019d like a frozen yogurt, please.", "Penny: Yogurt?", "Sheldon: Yeah.", "Penny: Um, okay, sure. Luckily, we sell both shoes and yogurt here.", "Sheldon: You do?", "Penny: Yes. Look up at the sign, and remember, improv is always about saying yes.", "Sheldon: All right. Yes. I see a sign. It says Camarillo State Mental Hospital.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s the only explanation I can come up with for why you think you sell shoes and yogurt.", "Penny: Okay, you know what? Let\u2019s just try a different improv. Uh, oh, this time we will be two winos living under a freeway overpass.", "Sheldon: Oh, and we\u2019re going to use props?", "Penny: You bet. I had dreams, you know. I was gonna be famous. Show everybody back home I could be someone. Now look at me. Want some?", "Sheldon: You have any frozen yogurt?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: I\u2019m still not adjusted to how the SyFy channel spells their name now. S-Y-F-Y. That\u2019s siffy.", "Raj: Uh-huh.", "Leonard (phone rings): Hello? Oh, my God! Is he okay?", "Raj: What happened?", "Leonard: Hang on. Hang on. Uh-huh. Okay, thank you. Howard was on his scooter, and got hit by a truck. He\u2019s in critical condition.", "Raj: Oh, no!", "Bernadette: Did you hear? Isn\u2019t it terrible?", "Leonard: Have you seen him?", "Bernadette: They wouldn\u2019t let me in. Oh my Howie.", "Leonard: It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay.", "Raj: It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay. (Phone rings) It\u2019s Howard. Howard, hello.", "Howard: Raj, is that you?", "Raj: Yeah, I\u2019m right here, buddy. How are you?", "Howard: Shh, shh. Listen to me. I\u2019m not gonna make it.", "Raj: No, no, no, don\u2019t say that. You\u2019re going to be all right.", "Howard: Raj, I don\u2019t have time. Now, pay attention. My last wish is that you look after Bernadette.", "Raj: Of course, of course. Now when you say look after, you mean\u2026", "Bernadette: Sexually.", "Raj: Excuse me, Bernadette. I have to hear it from him.", "Howard: Sexually.", "Raj: Got it. Take care. I guess I have no choice but to make sweet, guilt-free love to you over and over again for the rest of my life.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s how I heard it.", "Leonard (out of Raj\u2019s daydream): Or it could be sy-fee.", "Raj: What?", "Leonard: S-Y-F-Y. Sy-fee.", "Raj: Oh, right. Good one.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: So, did you get a chance to go over the scene I gave you?", "Sheldon: Yes. I didn\u2019t care for it.", "Penny: Okay, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is an American classic.", "Sheldon: So is the McRib sandwich. I don\u2019t care for that, either.", "Penny: Fine. What would you rather do as a scene study?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m glad you asked. I took the liberty of adapting a Star Trek fan fiction novella I wrote when I was ten into a one-act play.", "Penny: And you think it\u2019s better than Tennessee Williams?", "Sheldon: Why don\u2019t we leave that for future generations to decide?", "Penny: Where No Sheldon Has Gone Before.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s the story of a young boy who is transported from the ignorant backwoods of East Texas to the 23rd Century, where his genius is not only appreciated, but celebrated.", "Penny: KMN.", "Sheldon: Now, in this pivotal scene, Sheldon\u2019s mother, played by you, argues with an emissary of the United Federation of Planets, Mr. Spock, the role I will bring to life.", "Penny: Okay, that\u2019s fine, but let\u2019s try and get you out of your comfort zone.", "Sheldon: Why would we want to do that? It\u2019s called the comfort zone for a reason.", "Penny: Okay, the whole point of this is to loosen you up a little, so I\u2019m thinking you\u2019ll play the role of your mother, and I will bring life to Mr. Spock.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019ll be Spock?", "Penny: It\u2019s only logical.", "Sheldon: Very well. I\u2019ll set the scene.", "Penny: All right.", "Sheldon: East Texas. A warm summer night. A woman, Mary, stands on a porch. In the distance, we hear a lonesome train whistle. Woo-woo. The droning buzz of cicadas. Zzzzzzzzz. A coyote howls at the moon, frightening sensitive young boys everywhere. Aw-aw-aw! Out in the woods, an owl screeches.", "Penny: Okay, okay. We get it. You set the scene.", "Sheldon: Hoo!", "Penny: Now just read your mother\u2019s line.", "Sheldon: Shelly! Shelly, how many times have I told you not to leave your sciencey stuff out on the porch? Goodness, I\u2019ll never understand that boy. But then again, I\u2019m a religious nut, and my mind is closed to so many things.", "Penny: Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo. Spock to Enterprise. Transport successful.", "Sheldon: Glory be to Heaven, some sort of creature just manifested out of thin air. George, put down that Pepsi can full of bourbon that ain\u2019t foolin\u2019 no one, and get your shotgun!", "Penny: Greetings, Mary Cooper. I am Spock.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t buy it.", "Penny: Just keep going!", "Sheldon: Oh, my, your sudden appearance startles me.", "Penny: We have been monitoring your son Sheldon from the 23rd Century, and we have determined that he is now ready to join us. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy.", "Sheldon: I understand. Oh, Shelly? A man\u2019s here to take you away to the future! Be sure to pack clean underwear.\u201d", "Penny: Okay, okay, let\u2019s try that last line again, and this time, maybe try choking up a little.", "Sheldon: Why?", "Penny: Well, you\u2019re losing your son.", "Sheldon: Yes, but he\u2019s going to a better place where he won\u2019t get beat up. So much.", "Penny: All right, come on, just try it my way. Pretend you\u2019re sad to see him go. I\u2019m gonna lead you in. His unique genius is our best hope for bringing peace to a vast and troubled galaxy. That\u2019s your cue.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I just love that line. Even the way you do it.", "Penny: All right, come on, come on. Put some real emotion into it. Blah-blah, blah, blah, vast and troubled galaxy. Go.", "Sheldon: Oh, Shelly? A man\u2019s here to take you away to the future. Be sure to pack clean underwear.", "Penny: That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good.", "Sheldon: Mommy, why are you crying? \u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna miss you, Shelly-bean, even though you creep the bejeezus out of me.", "Penny: Okay, I guess we\u2019re improvising now.", "Sheldon: Well I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not my fault. I\u2019m just incredibly smart, and everyone around here is dumber than a bag of rocks. Oh, now, don\u2019t you start crying. You get in that spaceship. Mommy\u2019s late for Indian bingo.", "Penny (on phone): Mrs. Cooper, hey, it\u2019s Penny. Yeah, I think I broke your son. Hey, hold on. Talk to your mother.", "Sheldon: Mommy, I love you. Don\u2019t let Spock take me to the future!", "Scene: The cafeteria. ", "Bernadette: Okay, Raj, I know you\u2019ve been avoiding me and Howard, and I\u2019m not leaving until you tell me what\u2019s going on inside that little head of yours.", "(Scene turns into a Bollywood musical)", "Raj (singing): Like the wild elephant I am trumpeting my love for you!", "Bernadette (singing): Like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance comes into view!", "Raj (singing): My heart burns for you like the sun at noon!", "Bernadette (singing): My desert welcomes you like the rainy monsoon!", "Raj (singing): You are my heart!", "Bernadette (singing): My universe!", "Raj (singing): You are my heart!", "Bernadette (singing): My universe!", "Both together (singing): My universe!", "Chorus of everyone in cafeteria (singing):  Hey! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! You are my heart! My universe! My universe!", "Raj (out of daydream): Dance number aside, I\u2019m so not gay."]}
