{"series": "4", "episode": "02", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has a series of whiteboards across the room.", "Leonard: Whatcha doin\u2019 there? Working on a new plan to catch the roadrunner?", "Sheldon: The humorous implication being that I am Wile E. Coyote?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: What I\u2019m doing here is trying to determine when I\u2019m going to die.", "Leonard: A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?", "Sheldon: My family history factoring in longevity, propensity for disease, et cetera.", "Leonard: Interesting. Cause of death for Uncle Carl was KBB. What\u2019s KBB?", "Sheldon: Killed by badger.", "Leonard: How\u2019s that?", "Sheldon: It was Thanksgiving. Uncle Carl said, I think there\u2019s a badger living in our chimney. Hand me that flashlight. Those were the last words he ever spoke to us.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think you need to worry about death by badgers being hereditary.", "Sheldon: Not true. The fight or flight instinct is coded genetically. Instead of fleeing, he chose to fight barehanded against a brawny member of the weasel family. Who\u2019s to say that I don\u2019t share that flawed DNA?", "Leonard: You can always get a badger and find out.", "Sheldon: But seriously, even if I disregard the Uncle Carl factor, at best I have 60 years left.", "Leonard: That long, huh?", "Sheldon: 60 only takes me to here. I need to get to here.", "Leonard: What\u2019s there?", "Sheldon: The earliest estimate of the singularity, when man will be able to transfer his consciousness into machines and achieve immortality.", "Leonard: So, you\u2019re upset about missing out on becoming some sort of freakish self-aware robot?", "Sheldon: By this much.", "Leonard: Tough break. You want eggs?", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t get it, Leonard. I\u2019m going to miss so much, the unified field theory,\u00a0 cold fusion, the dogapus.", "Leonard: What\u2019s a dogapus?", "Sheldon: A hybrid dog and octopus. Man\u2019s underwater best friend.", "Leonard: Is somebody working on that?", "Sheldon: I was going to. I planned on giving it to myself on my 300th birthday.", "Leonard: Wait a minute. You hate dogs.", "Sheldon: A dogapus can play fetch with eight balls. No one can hate that.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: What do we owe you?", "Leonard: It came to $28.17. Let\u2019s say six bucks apiece.", "Howard: Here you go.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: Never mind. I got it.", "Penny: Oh, you wanted me to pay.", "Leonard: It\u2019s no big deal.", "Penny: No, no, no, no. You\u2019re right. We\u2019re not going out anymore, I should pay for myself. (After Raj whispers to Howard, and Howard laughs) What?", "Howard: He said if he had woman parts, he\u2019d eat for free the rest of his life.", "Penny: Yeah, but you wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to yourself. I\u2019m a little low on cash.", "Leonard: Hmm? How much you got?", "Penny: Nothing.", "Leonard: How can you walk around with no money?", "Penny: I\u2019m cute. I get by.", "Leonard: It\u2019s okay, you can owe me.", "Penny: Okay.", "Leonard: Sheldon, six bucks.", "Sheldon: No, thank you. I\u2019m not eating pizza tonight.", "Penny: But it\u2019s Thursday. Thursday\u2019s pizza night.", "Sheldon: Not for me. Thursday is now Cruciferous Vegetable Night. Tonight\u2019s selection, brussels sprouts.", "Howard: Really? You\u2019re changing the Sheldonian calendar?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a small price to pay.", "Penny: For what?", "Leonard: No, no, don\u2019t ask.", "Penny: Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.", "Sheldon: In order to live long enough to fuse my consciousness with cybernetics, I need to change my diet.", "Penny: Wait. Cybernetics is robot stuff, right?", "Sheldon: Correct.", "Penny: So you want to turn yourself into some sort of robot?", "Sheldon: Essentially, yes.", "Penny: Okay, here\u2019s my question. Didn\u2019t you already do that?", "Sheldon: Flattering, but sadly, no. I\u2019m also planning to begin an exercise regimen designed to strengthen my cardiovascular system. AKA jogging.", "Penny: Wait. Honey,have you ever run before?", "Sheldon: Certainly. I\u2019ve run from bullies, dogs, angry chickens, and one particularly persistent P.E. teacher determined to bend me over and give me a scoliosis test.", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): You\u2019re right, Penny jogs. Maybe you guys can run together.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s an excellent idea. Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.", "Penny: No, it won\u2019t. Um, how does he know I jog?", "Howard: Oh, he watches you from his car with high-powered binoculars.", "Penny: Oh, my God, that is so creepy!", "Howard: I know! (Raj whispers to him) And he says he\u2019s not gonna stop. (Raj whispers to him urgently) Then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom", "Sheldon (off): (Knock, knock, knock) Ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) U-u-ugh. (Knock, knock, knock) Lenu-u-ugh.", "Leonard: What the hell? What\u2019s the matter?", "Sheldon: I have pain radiating from my navel to my lower right abdomen. I\u2019m nauseated and feverish. I believe I may have cholera.", "Leonard: There\u2019s no cholera in Pasadena. Just like last summer, when there was no malaria in Pasadena.", "Sheldon: Well, if it\u2019s not cholera, then based on a quick Internet search, the other explanations in decreasing order of likelihood are Hirschsprung\u2019s Disease, botulism, a 30-foot tapeworm or accidental ingestion of chrysanthemum blossoms.", "Leonard: When would you have accidentally eaten chrysanthemum blossoms?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s part of an unlikely scenario that involves sleepwalking and a 24-hour flower mart with a less-than-vigilant proprietor. Oh, Lord, my belly!", "Leonard: Have you had your appendix out?", "Sheldon: I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been meaning to, but who has the time?", "Leonard: Let\u2019s get you to the hospital.", "Sheldon: So this is how it ends, with cruel irony. Just as I make the commitment to preserving my body, I am betrayed by my appendix, a vestigial organ. Do you know the original purpose of the appendix, Leonard?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: I do. And yet I\u2019m doomed while you live on.", "Leonard: Funny how things work out, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I think it\u2019s about to burst! (Loud sound of farting) On the other hand, it might have been the Brussels sprouts.", "Leonard: Good night.", "Sheldon: Good night. Appendicitis. What a nervous Nelly.", "Scene: The hallway.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: Coming, coming. Hey, nice knees.", "Sheldon: Thank you. They\u2019re my mother\u2019s.", "Penny: Oh. And the Flash shirt is what? Because you\u2019re gonna run really fast?", "Sheldon: No, the Flash shirt is because it\u2019s Friday, but it\u2019s nice when things work out. Where\u2019s your heart rate monitor?", "Penny: I don\u2019t have one.", "Sheldon: What about your pedometer?", "Penny: Don\u2019t have one.", "Sheldon: Do you have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?", "Penny: Uh, no.", "Sheldon: What do you do, you just go out there and gambol about like a bunny?", "Penny: No. I just run till I\u2019m hungry, then I stop for a bear claw.", "Sheldon: Why are you doing that?", "Penny: It\u2019s good to stretch your muscles before you run.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: All right, let\u2019s start with a toe touch. Okay, you do it.", "Sheldon: I am doing it.", "Penny: Oh. Wow. Good job. Okay, um, can you do this?", "Sheldon: We\u2019ll never know.", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s just warm up on the run.", "Sheldon: Okay.", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s go.", "Sheldon: Yeah, I\u2019ve been reading up on biomechanics. I think you\u2019ll be surprised at my\u2026 Wah! Oh!", "Penny (squealing): Oh, my God, are you okay?", "Sheldon: I think so.", "Penny: Oh, let me help you up.", "Sheldon: Thank you. (Loud sound of farting)", "Penny: Oh, Sheldon!", "Sheldon: If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer Cruciferous Vegetable Night.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Here\u2019s my chicken curry. Howard, your shrimp biryani.", "Howard: Thank you, sir.", "Leonard: Palak paneer, that\u2019s Penny.", "Penny: Thanks.", "Leonard: And for Rajesh Koothrappali, from whose homeland these tasty dishes originate, one large order of chicken McNuggets.", "Penny: Hey, what\u2019s my share?", "Leonard: Uh, 12 bucks.", "Penny: Okay, can I get you after Friday when I get paid?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Penny: What am I up to now?", "Leonard: Well, okay, with the Indian food, the pizza, the Thai food, the tank of gas, the frozen yogurt and your rent, uh, a little over fourteen hundred dollars.", "Penny (after Raj whispers to Howard and they both laugh): What now?", "Howard: He\u2019s just expressing his admiration that you don\u2019t even have to put out to get free stuff.", "Penny: It\u2019s not free, I\u2019m gonna pay him back. (Raj whispers. Both laugh again) Shut up!", "Leonard: Sheldon, are you gonna join us?", "Sheldon: Coming! (From the bedroom area, a wheeled device consisting of a base, a tee-shirt on a coat hanger, and a computer monitor with Sheldon\u2019s face, appears). Greetings, friends.", "Leonard: Greetings, whatever the hell you are.", "Sheldon-bot: I am a mobile virtual presence device. Recent events have demonstrated to me that my body is too fragile to endure the vicissitudes of the world. Until such time as I am able to transfer my consciousness, I shall remain in a secure location and interact with the world in this manner.", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): Really? That\u2019s your question? When did he put a ramp in?", "Sheldon-bot: You\u2019re in my spot. This may seem a little odd at first, but over time you\u2019ll grow accustomed to dealing with me in this configuration.", "Penny: Yeah, to be honest, I don\u2019t see much difference.", "Sheldon-bot: Thank you. That\u2019s what I was going for. Now, Leonard, tomorrow, when we go to work, you\u2019ll need to allow some extra time to get me down the stairs. For your convenience, I disassemble into four pieces.", "Leonard: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m coming to talk to you.", "Sheldon-bot: You don\u2019t know where I am. My physical body is safely ensconced in a secure, undisclosed location.", "Leonard: You\u2019re in your bedroom.", "Sheldon-bot: No, I\u2019m not.", "Leonard: I can hear your voice coming from your bedroom.", "Sheldon-bot: No, you can\u2019t. Wait. Come back. Halt. Authorized personnel only!", "Penny: So, either one of you weirdos want to buy my underwear? Only fourteen hundred bucks.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Leonard: Sheldon, this is ridiculous.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m behind you. Please look at me when you\u2019re talking to me.", "Leonard: I am looking at you.", "Sheldon: No, you\u2019re not. Pay no attention to that man in the bed.", "Leonard: You cannot exist as a virtual presence. Not here and certainly not at work. Oh, good God.", "Sheldon: At my age, do you know how I\u2019m statistically most likely to die?", "Leonard: At the hands of your roommate?", "Sheldon: An accident.", "Leonard: That\u2019s how I\u2019m going to make it look.", "Sheldon: Until I can transfer my intellect to a more durable container, my body will remain safely ensconced in my bed.", "Leonard: Fine, but don\u2019t expect my help.", "Sheldon: You have to help, it\u2019s in the roommate agreement.", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s not.", "Sheldon: Section 74.C. The various obligations and duties of the parties in the event one of them becomes a robot.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll be damned.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car", "Sheldon-bot: This is delightful.", "Leonard: Uh-huh.", "Sheldon-bot: It\u2019s much easier to enjoy the picturesque route we travel to work when you remove the spectre of fiery vehicular death.", "Leonard: Refresh my memory. Why didn\u2019t I just put you in the trunk?", "Sheldon-bot: Because I called shotgun. Remember?", "Leonard: Right.", "Sheldon-bot: You seem tense. Perhaps this will relax you.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to listen to music, Sheldon.", "Sheldon-bot: Very well. I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re not enjoying this. Together, in this car, with my enhanced capabilities, we\u2019re like Knight Rider.", "Leonard: Except in Knight Rider, the car isn\u2019t a yammering sphincter.", "Sheldon-bot: You mock the sphincter, but the sphincter is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn\u2019t survive. There are over 50 different sphincters in the human body. How many can you name?", "Leonard: I was wrong, this is exactly like Knight Rider.", "Sheldon-bot: Perhaps you\u2019d be interested in a different game.", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon-bot: This is a photograph of the 1911 Solvay Conference on the theory of radiation and quanta. Using Photoshop, I\u2019ve introduced a few anachronisms. See if you can spot all 24. I\u2019ll give you the first one. Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch. And go.", "Leonard: That\u2019s it. Bye-bye. (Turns off screen.)", "Sheldon-bot (screen switching itself back on): Bazinga.", "Leonard: Whoa!", "Sheldon-bot: I have an override switch.", "Leonard: I almost died!", "Sheldon-bot : And I\u2019m safe and sound in bed. Who\u2019s crazy now?", "Leonard: I\u2019m still going to go with you.", "Scene: A corridor at the university.", "Sheldon-bot : Hello, Professor Hoskins. Nice to see you, Mindy. Konichi-wa Dr. Nakamora. Sorry the Swedes disproved your theory. Leonard, my door.", "Leonard: What about it?", "Sheldon-bot : Be a lamb and open it for me.", "Leonard: Why? What\u2019s the problem?", "Sheldon-bot : You think you have me stymied, don\u2019t you?", "Leonard: No, I think a doorknob has you stymied.", "Howard: Oh, look, it\u2019s Leonard and R2-D-Bag.", "Raj: That\u2019s my joke. I told it last night. You can\u2019t just use it.", "Sheldon-bot : Raj, be a lamb and open the door for me.", "Raj: Oh, sure.", "Sheldon-bot : He\u2019s a lamb. You\u2019re not.", "Raj: I\u2019m a lamb.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory", "Sheldon-bot : Isn\u2019t this nice? The pleasures of fellowship and camaraderie without having to tolerate your germy breath on my skin.", "Howard: I say we just take him to Tatooine and sell him to some Jawas.", "Raj: That\u2019s two, dude. Write your own jokes.", "Penny: Oh, great. Hi, I\u2019m Penny, I\u2019ll be your waitress.", "Leonard: Why are you introducing yourself?", "Penny: I\u2019d rather people not know I have any prior connection to you whatsoever.", "Sheldon-bot : Can you tell me the specials this evening?", "Penny: Sheldon, I\u2019m not waiting on you.", "Sheldon-bot: Obviously. I don\u2019t even have water yet.", "Penny: Because you\u2019re not here.", "Sheldon-bot: That\u2019s discrimination against the otherwise located. I\u2019m going to have to go over your head. Manager, manager. Oh, Lord, look who it is.", "Howard: Is that Steve Wozniak?", "Leonard: I think it is.", "Sheldon-bot : The Great and Powerful Woz.", "Leonard: Penny, Steve Wozniak was one of the cofounders of Apple Computer. He and Steve Jobs started it\u2026", "Penny: Yeah, I know who he is. I watch Dancing with the Stars.", "Sheldon-bot : I must speak to him.", "Leonard: Of course you must.", "Penny: You know, there\u2019s an Olive Garden down the street. You guys should try it sometime.", "Sheldon-bot : Excuse me, Mr. Wozniak?", "Steve Wozniak: Oh, hey. Nice virtual presence device.", "Sheldon-bot : Thank you. I just want to say I\u2019m a big fan. You\u2019re my fifteenth favourite technological visionary.", "Steve Wozniak: Only fifteenth?", "Sheldon-bot : It\u2019s still six spots above Steve Jobs. I care neither for turtlenecks nor showmanship.", "Steve Wozniak: Yeah, I never got that turtleneck thing.", "Sheldon-bot : One of my proudest possessions is a vintage 1977 Apple Two. Despite the file system limitations of Apple DOS 3.3, it was a pretty nifty little achievement.", "Steve Wozniak: Thanks, we were shooting for nifty. You know, if you had it here, I\u2019d autograph it for you.", "Sheldon-bot: Don\u2019t move for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on how the buses are running.", "Steve Wozniak: Nerds.", "Scene: The hallway. Sheldon exits carrying the Apple 2.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m coming, Woz, I\u2019m coming. (Trips on stairs.) Ow! Aw.", "Scene: The hallway. Sheldon-bot approaches Penny\u2019s door and starts bashing into it.", "Sheldon-bot : (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny. (Bash) Penny.", "Penny: What up, Shel-Bot?", "Sheldon-bot: I can\u2019t get out of bed. I hurt my ankle.", "Penny: What do you want me to do?", "Sheldon-bot: Sing me Soft Kitty.", "Penny: Really, you want me to sing Soft Kitty to a computer monitor?", "Sheldon-bot: Would you rather come over and sing it to me in person?", "Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur.", "Sheldon-bot: Closer to the microphone.", "Penny: Happy kitty, sleepy\u2026", "Sheldon-bot: No. You have to start over.", "Penny: Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur. Happy kitty, sleepy kitty, purr, purr, purr."]}
