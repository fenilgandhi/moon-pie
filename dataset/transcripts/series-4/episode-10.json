{"series": "4", "episode": "10", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. ", "Sheldon: Clarify something for me. Isn\u2019t the point of a communal meal the exchange of ideas and opinions? An opportunity to consider important issues of the day?", "Leonard: It is. You just kind of put a damper on things when you said, the next person I see talking with food in their mouth will be put to death.", "Sheldon: Well, we could argue about who said what all night long, but to set things back on course, I will propose a new topic of conversation.", "Leonard: Great.", "Sheldon: What is the best number? By the way, there\u2019s only one correct answer.", "Raj: Five million, three hundred eighteen thousand and eight?", "Sheldon: Wrong. The best number is 73. You\u2019re probably wondering why.", "Leonard: No.", "Howard: Uh-uh.", "Raj: We\u2019re good.", "Sheldon: 73 is the 21st prime number. Its mirror, 37, is the 12th, and its mirror, 21, is the product of multiplying, hang on to your hats, seven and three. Eh? Eh? Did I lie?", "Leonard: We get it. 73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.", "Sheldon: Chuck Norris wishes. In binary, 73 is a palindrome, one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one which backwards is one-zero-zero-one-zero-zero-one, exactly the same. All Chuck Norris backwards gets you is Sirron Kcuhc.", "Raj: Just for the record, when you enter five million three hundred eighteen thousand and eight in a calculator, upside-down it spells boobies.", "Leonard: Remember when you were wondering why the girls didn\u2019t want to eat with us tonight?", "Howard: Yeah, I get it now.", "Scene: A bar.", "Penny: I love your little heart locket, Bernadette.", "Bernadette: Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me. It\u2019s the cutest thing. Every time I have dinner with his mom, the next day I get jewellery.", "Amy: Did you know that the iconic Valentine\u2019s heart shape is not actually based on the shape of a human heart, but rather on the shape of the buttocks of a female bending over?", "Penny: Oh, so I spent seventh grade dotting my I\u2019s with little asses? Cool.", "Zack: Hey, Penny, how\u2019s it going?", "Penny: Hey, Zack, what are you doing here?", "Zack: My dad\u2019s company prints the menus for this place. I\u2019m just dropping off some new ones laminated. Makes \u2019em easier to clean if people throw up on \u2019em. Guess how I got the idea?", "Penny: Yeah, I got it, I got it. Uh, Zack, these are my friends Bernadette and Amy.", "Bernadette: Hi.", "Zack: Hey.", "Amy: Hoo.", "Zack: Okay, well, it was good to see you.", "Penny: Yeah, you, too.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s really cute. How do you know him?", "Penny: Oh, we went out a couple of times.", "Amy: I\u2019m often flummoxed by current slang. Does went out mean had intercourse?", "Bernadette: Yes.", "Penny: No, no. But in this case, yes.", "Amy: Interesting. And was it not satisfactory?", "Penny: No, it was great. He just didn\u2019t really challenge me on an intellectual level.", "Bernadette: Couldn\u2019t you just fool around with him and then listen to NPR?", "Penny: Wouldn\u2019t help. Zack can\u2019t even spell NPR.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s what I do with Howard. I\u2019m much smarter than he is. But it\u2019s important to protect his manhood.", "Amy: Hoo.", "Bernadette: What\u2019s the matter?", "Amy: I\u2019m suddenly feeling flushed. My heart rate is elevated, my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry. In addition, I keep involuntarily saying hoo.", "Penny: Oh, we know what\u2019s causing that, don\u2019t we?", "Amy: It\u2019s no mystery. I obviously have the flu coupled with sudden-onset Tourette\u2019s syndrome.", "Credits sequence. ", "\u00a0", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Howard: Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?", "Leonard: No. What happened?", "Howard: They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.", "Raj: Did he get superpowers?", "Howard: No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.", "Raj: Oh. Well, that\u2019s disappointing.", "Howard: Why?", "Raj: Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.", "Howard: Yeah, but who\u2019d want to become Rat-Man?", "Raj: Who wouldn\u2019t? You could zip through a maze in nothing flat, squeeze through really small holes, and shut down restaurants in a single bound. And the best part is, if I were Rat-Man, you could be my sidekick, Mouse Boy.", "Howard: Mouse Boy?", "Raj: You don\u2019t like Mouse Boy? How about, uh, uh, Kid Vermin?", "Howard: First of all, if we had superpowers, I wouldn\u2019t be the sidekick. You\u2019d be the sidekick.", "Raj: Rat-Man is nobody\u2019s sidekick.", "Howard: Leonard, settle this. Of the two of us, who\u2019s the obvious sidekick?", "Raj: Yeah, Leonard, who?", "Leonard: 12 years after high school, and I\u2019m still at the nerd table.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s lab. ", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t you slicing that man\u2019s brain a little too thin?", "Amy: It\u2019s too thin if I were making a foot-long brain sandwich at Quiznos. For examination under a two-photon microscope, it\u2019s fine.", "Sheldon: Well, you\u2019re the expert. If the correct way to do it is the wrong way, then I yield.", "Amy: Very well. If you die and donate your body to science, I promise to slice your brain like Canadian bacon.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have to take my temperature.", "Sheldon: Are you monitoring your circadian rhythms in order to identify your periods of maximum mental acuity? I did that one summer. Ah, youth.", "Amy: No, I experienced some distressing symptoms last night, so I\u2019m checking my vital signs every hour.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d be happy to create a chart and participate in a differential diagnosis.", "Amy: Oh, that sounds like fun.", "Sheldon: All right. What were the symptoms?", "Amy: Elevated heart rate, moist palms, dry mouth and localized vascular throbbing.", "Sheldon: Localized to what region?", "Amy: Ears and genitalia.", "Sheldon: Interesting. Not body parts that usually team up. What about environmental factors? Describe the scene for me.", "Amy: I was sitting in a restaurant with Penny and Bernadette, drinking water, carbonated as it was a special occasion. Penny\u2019s friend Zack stopped by and said hello and I said hoo.", "Sheldon: Who?", "Amy: Zack.", "Sheldon: Then why did you ask?", "Amy: Ask what?", "Sheldon: Who.", "Amy: Zack.", "Sheldon: All right, let\u2019s start over. What did you say when Zack walked in?", "Amy: Hoo.", "Sheldon: Zack.", "Amy: Why do you keep saying Zack?", "Sheldon: Because you keep saying who.", "Amy: I\u2019m not saying hoo now. I said hoo last night.", "Sheldon: And the answer was Zack, correct?", "Amy: There was no question. I simply said hoo.", "Sheldon: All right, I think I have enough to go on. Possible explanations for your symptoms are, in descending order of likelihood, hyperthyroidism, premature menopause, hosting an alien parasite or, and I only include it for the sake of covering absolutely all bases, sexual arousal.", "Amy: Where would I have picked up an alien parasite?", "Scene: The cafeteria. ", "\u00a0", "Howard: There you are.", "Raj: Oh, hey.", "Howard: Let me ask you a question. What are you most afraid of?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know. Um, nuclear war. Accidentally being buried alive. Any of those movies where you get that phone call that says you\u2019re going to die, and then you do.", "Howard: No. Something very specific that we both know you, Rajesh Koothrappali, are terrified of.", "Raj: Well, type two diabetes runs in my family. The thought of losing a toe\u2026", "Howard: Spiders! You\u2019re afraid of spiders!", "Raj: What the heck is this?", "Howard: A jar with a big spider in it, of course. Bravery test. First one to take his hand out is the sidekick.", "Raj: Are you crazy?", "Howard: Perhaps. Are you scared?", "Raj: No. But it\u2019s a stupid test.", "Howard: Oh, really? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to stick your hand in a jar with a spider?", "Raj: Oh, yeah? What if the earth was in danger and the only way to save it was to take a shower in the locker room and let other guys see you naked?", "Howard: Oh, come on. That\u2019s never gonna happen. Now put your hand in the jar or forever be revealed as my sidekick.", "Raj: All right, I will.", "Howard: How did you get so brave all of a sudden?", "Raj: It\u2019s easy. The spider\u2019s crawling up your arm.", "Howard: Get it off! Get it off! Please, Raj! Ah! Ah! Ah! Please. Oh!", "Scene: Amy\u2019s lab. ", "Amy: My blood work shows thyroid function normal. Cortisol levels normal.", "Sheldon: How about your follicle-stimulating hormone levels?", "Amy: Sheldon, I am not going through menopause.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? You said that with the testy bark of an old biddy.", "Amy: I think we need to face the cold, hard truth, I was sexually aroused by Penny\u2019s friend Zack.", "Sheldon: Hang on. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve given the alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.", "Amy: Let\u2019s look at this logically. I have a stomach, I get hungry. I have genitals, I have the potential for sexual arousal.", "Sheldon: A cross we all must bear. You know, in difficult moments like this, I often turn to a force greater than myself.", "Amy: Religion?", "Sheldon: Star Trek. Did you see Star Trek: The Motion Picture?", "Amy: No.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t. It\u2019s terrible. However, in it, we learn that when Spock finds himself drawn off the path of logic by feelings bubbling up from his human half, he suppresses them using the Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinar.", "Amy: Are you suggesting we live our lives guided by the philosophies found in cheap science fiction?", "Sheldon: Cheap science fiction?", "Amy: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: Using Kolinar to suppress my anger at that last comment.", "Amy: Is it possible that your concern for me at this moment is motivated by nothing more than simple jealousy?", "Sheldon: I hadn\u2019t considered that. Give me a moment. All right, I\u2019ve considered it.", "Amy: And?", "Sheldon: I reject it.", "Amy: You reject it because you don\u2019t feel jealousy, or because you are suppressing jealousy?", "Sheldon: I think I\u2019ll eat my lunch at home.", "Amy: That\u2019s not your lunch, Sheldon, those are the cadaver brain specimens.", "Sheldon: Oh. As they were incorrectly sliced, you can see how I could mistake them for my sashimi.", "Scene: The laundry room.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: Hey. Isn\u2019t tomorrow your usual laundry night?", "Sheldon: The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener. If this one under or over-softens, I\u2019ll need time to make things right.", "Penny: That\u2019s thinking ahead.", "Sheldon: The alternative would be to think backwards. And that\u2019s just remembering.", "Penny: So how\u2019s Amy?", "Sheldon: Amy\u2019s changed. I might have to let her go.", "Penny: Oh, no. Why?", "Sheldon: I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me. But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges. Like you.", "Penny: Just going to skip over that insult.", "Sheldon: What insult?", "Penny: Yeah. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to skip over it. Are you saying that Amy is, oh, what\u2019s the", "scientific word?", "Sheldon: Forget science. She\u2019s horny.", "Penny: Oh! Okay. Wow.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s simple biology. There\u2019s nothing I can do about it.", "Penny: Are you sure?", "Sheldon: What are you suggesting?", "Penny: I\u2019m suggesting there might be something you could do about Amy\u2019s urges?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s illegal to spay a human being.", "Penny: Yeah. That\u2019s not what I had in mind.", "Sheldon: Oh. Oh! You mean something I could do.", "Penny: Exactly.", "Sheldon: Well, I was hoping to avoid this. But I might as well get it over with. Thank you, Penny. I\u2019ll let you know what happens.", "Penny: Oh, Amy, you lucky girl.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.", "Sheldon: Yes. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Is this the Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny? Sorry to bother you. Hello. I\u2019m looking for a Zack Johnson who used to have coitus with my neighbour Penny. Coitus. It means intercourse. And I have a feeling I\u2019m speaking to the right Zack. This is Sheldon Cooper. Fine. Shelly. Yes, that does sound like a girl\u2019s name. No, it doesn\u2019t bother me. Yes, Smelly Shelly does bother me. Let me tell you why I\u2019m calling. I\u2019d like to know if you\u2019d be interested in having sex with Amy Farrah Fowler. Amy Farrah Fowler. Yes, that is a girl\u2019s name. Good grief. It\u2019s like trying to talk to a dolphin.", "Scene: A gymnasium. ", "Leonard: Really? This is going to decide who\u2019s the hero and who\u2019s the sidekick?", "Howard: You got a better idea?", "Leonard: Every idea is better than this idea.", "Howard: Ding!", "Raj: Wait. What the hell is ding?", "Howard: It\u2019s a bell.", "Raj: I don\u2019t think this kind of wrestling has a bell.", "Howard: Fine. How do you want to start?", "Raj: I say, uh, how about one, two, three, go?", "Howard: One-two-three-go? That\u2019s for babies.", "Raj: Okay, how about, uh, on your mark, get set, go?", "Howard: That\u2019s for a footrace. If you want to race, we have to go outside.", "Raj: No, it\u2019s chilly outside. Didn\u2019t bring my jacket.", "Howard: Oh, for crying out loud. What kind of superhero needs a jacket?", "Raj: What kind of superhero says dibs on the red tights, dibs on the red tights.", "Howard: All right, how about this? Ready, wrestle.", "Raj: Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you\u2019re going to say when we do start, or\u2026", "Howard: We\u2019re starting now!", "Raj: Don\u2019t yell at me!", "Leonard: Suppose there are worse ways to spend a Friday night. None come to mind.", "Scene: A bar.", "Sheldon: Look at this stamp. On what authority are they permitted to mutilate patrons as they enter?", "Amy: I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll wash off.", "Sheldon: Little comfort tonight. I look like a Hell\u2019s Angel.", "Amy: There\u2019s Zack.", "Sheldon: Are you sure this is what you want to do?", "Amy: It\u2019s not what I want to do, it\u2019s what I have to do.", "Sheldon: Go, Amy Farrah Fowler. Follow your endocrine system.", "Amy: Thank you, Sheldon. You\u2019re a good friend.", "Sheldon: Please don\u2019t drag this out. This is never going to come off.", "Amy: Excuse me? Zack? I am Amy Farrah Fowler. We met the other night. I have spent my life in pursuit of pure knowledge. Until I met you, my decisions were founded in logic and reason. And yet here I stand before you, 130 pounds of raging estrogen, longing to grab hold of your gluteus maximus and make Shakespeare\u2019s metaphorical beast with two backs.", "Zack: My gluteus what?", "Amy: On the other hand, as I look at the blank, ape-like expression on your face, I have decided to adopt the Vulcan practice of Kolinar. Good-bye, Zack.", "Zack: Bye. Hoo. That should hold me for a while.", "Scene: The gymnasium.", "Howard: I\u2019m legally obligated to inform you that I took a karate lesson when I was 11. I\u2019d be a regular ninja by now if my mom could\u2019ve arranged a carpool.", "Raj: Oh, yeah? Well, I\u2019ve been taking Pilates class at the rec center, and my abs look like sections of a Hershey bar.", "Howard: Oh, yeah? Won\u2019t matter, you\u2019re going down!", "Raj: No, uh-uh, you\u2019re going down!", "Howard: If anybody\u2019s going to go down, it\u2019s going to be you.", "Leonard: Fellas. It\u2019s been 30 minutes. Nobody\u2019s touched each other.", "Scene: A street. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019m glad you decided to reject your animal hindbrain and return to the realm of pure intellect.", "Amy: As am I. (Holds Sheldon\u2019s hand)", "Sheldon: What are you doing?", "Amy: An experiment. Nope. Nothing. Never mind.", "Scene: The gymnasium. ", "Raj: You realize you can\u2019t win.", "Howard: I prefer to think that I can\u2019t lose.", "Raj: You\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s only a matter of time before you fall into Rat-Man\u2019s rat trap.", "Howard: You pathetic fool! If there were a rat-catcher, wouldn\u2019t it catch Rat-Man?", "Raj: Just because I didn\u2019t express myself well doesn\u2019t mean my underlying point was invalid! You bloviating buffoon!", "Howard: You narcissistic nincompoop!", "Raj: You crimson coward! Oh, Leonard, wake up, you\u2019re missing some very excellent superhero quips."]}
