It was a desperate attempt to introduce an alternate topic of conversation.", "Leonard: My problem is, I don\u2019t project confidence. So I decided that the next time I meet a woman I think is attractive, rather than holding back and being cautious, I\u2019m going to assume the mantle of self-assurance.", "Raj: Oh, yeah? What\u2019s that look like?", "Leonard: Hi. I\u2019m Leonard. And you are beautiful. You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\u2019m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.", "Raj: Where are we going?", "Howard: Good news. I made it onto the team for the new Defence Department laser-equipped surveillance satellite.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. If we\u2019re changing topics, I believe I have first dibs with capybara, a rodent the size of a baby hippo.", "Leonard: Congratulations Howard.", "Howard: Thanks. Listen, I have to get a security clearance, so you guys might be hearing from the FBI.", "Raj: Whoa, whoa, whoa! I don\u2019t want to speak to the FBI.", "Leonard: Why not?", "Raj: I\u2019m brown and I talk funny.", "Howard: They\u2019re just doing a background check on me.", "Raj: It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019ll find a reason to give me a one-way ticket back to Gandhi-ville. By the way, when I say that, it\u2019s not offensive.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, Raj. You\u2019re here legally.", "Raj: Nobody cares. Do you know how long it\u2019s been since I got through airport security without being given a colonoscopy?", "Sheldon: You know, I try very hard to make our lunch hours educational and informative, but your insistence on talking about your own lives stymies me at every turn.", "Leonard: Fine, Sheldon, tell us about your giant rodents.", "Sheldon: No, you squandered your time with me, and the moment has now passed. Feast on your disappointment, much as the capybara feasts on its own waste.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. Raj is reading New Moon.", "Raj: Oh, Bella, don\u2019t you see? Edward\u2019s only pushing you away because he loves you. (Knock on door) Coming.", "Woman at Door: Dr. Koothrappali? (Raj nods) I\u2019m Special Agent Page, FBI. May I come in? (Nods again) I\u2019d like to talk to you about Howard Wolowitz. (Indicates sofa) Oh, thank you. All right. Well, how long have you known Mr. Wolowitz?", "Raj (Holds up finger to indicate he will be right back. Runs to kitchen. Tries to drink wine but bottle is empty. Looks in fridge and finds rum cake. Comes back stuffing a piece in his mouth): Rum cake?", "Page: No, thanks. Now, about Mr. Wolowitz.", "Raj: Seven years.", "Page: I see.", "Raj: I\u2019m in this country legally, you know.", "Page: I\u2019m sure you are. Now, to your knowledge, has Mr. Wolowitz ever committed a crime?", "Raj: Of course not. I\u2019m here on an H-1B visa, which means I can\u2019t be associated in any way with crime or criminal activity. And I\u2019m not.", "Page: Good. To your knowledge, does Mr. Wolowitz have any foreign contacts?", "Raj: No, just me. Oh, there it is. Here comes a cavity search.", "Page: Excuse me?", "Raj: Please don\u2019t send me back to India, it\u2019s so crowded. It\u2019s like the whole country is one endless Comic-Con, except everybody\u2019s wearing the same costume, Indian Guy.", "Page: Dr. Koothrappali, I\u2019m not\u2026", "Raj: I love this country! The-the baseball, the freedom, the rampant morbid obesity! From California to the New York Island, I\u2019m a real Yankee Doodle boy!", "Page: Dr. Koothrappali, please.", "Raj: My country \u2019tis of thee, duh duh duh liberty, It\u2019s really great.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s lab. ", "Leonard: So, when Howard said the FBI would be contacting me, I was expecting Mulder. Glad to see I got Scully.", "Page: Who?", "Leonard: Mulder and Scully. X-Files. The truth is out there. Never mind. Uh, so, what would you like to know?", "Page: You work with Mr. Wolowitz here at the university, correct?", "Leonard: Yes. Of course, we\u2019re in different departments. He\u2019s an engineer and I\u2019m an experimental physicist. You know, one of those guys who examines the building blocks of creation and says, Hello, maker of the universe, I see what you did there. Good one.", "Page: Right. Now, how would you characterize your relationship with Mr. Wolowitz?", "Leonard: Good. It\u2019s a good relationship. Of course, most of my relationships are good. Probably because I exude confidence. People are drawn to that, you know? Confidence, not exuding.", "Page: Do you know of any groups Mr. Wolowitz is a member of?", "Leonard: You are beautiful, you know that? You pop, sparkle and buzz electric. I\u2019m going to pick you up at eight, show you a night you will never forget.", "Page: Sounds great.", "Leonard: Really?", "Page: Yeah. Can my six-foot-two Navy SEAL husband come with us?", "Leonard: Is that, oh, my, I didn\u2019t see the ring with my glasses off, so, look at that, I\u2019m starting to exude.", "Scene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door.", "Leonard: Want to get that?", "Sheldon: Not particularly.", "Leonard: Could you get that?", "Sheldon: I suppose I could if I were asked.", "Leonard: Would you please get that?", "Sheldon: Of course. Why do you have to make things so complicated?", "Page: Dr. Cooper?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Page: I\u2019m Special Agent Page, FBI.", "Sheldon: You say you\u2019re Special Agent Page, FBI.", "Page: Here\u2019s my I.D.", "Sheldon: And here is my Justice League membership card. But that doesn\u2019t prove I know Batman.", "Page: I just want to ask you a few questions about Howard Wolowitz.", "Sheldon: Oh. All right. I doubt anyone would risk the stiff penalties for impersonating a federal officer just to ask questions about a minor league engineer with an unresolved Oedipal complex.", "Page: Thank you.", "Sheldon: For the record, I truly support the FBI in the mission which is expressed through their motto?", "Page: Fidelity, bravery, integrity?", "Sheldon: Correct. Now to business. 18 years ago, I sent the FBI Crime Lab samples from a bag of excrement that had been lit on fire on my front porch for fingerprinting and DNA analysis. Why haven\u2019t I heard back yet?", "Page: Well, the FBI Crime Lab does have a lot on its plate.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s of little comfort to a nation attempting to scrape burning feces off its shoes.", "Page: Would you mind if we talked about Mr. Wolowitz now?", "Sheldon: A little, but go on.", "Page: Thank you. Would you characterize him as responsible?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m going to answer that with a visual aid. This is my nine-disc complete Lord of the Rings trilogy blu-ray set.\u00a0 Mr. Wolowitz borrowed it, damaged plastic retention hub number three, and then returned it to me, hoping I wouldn\u2019t notice. Would you characterize that as responsible?", "Page: That\u2019s really not the sort of thing we\u2019re interested in.", "Sheldon: You heard me say blu-ray, right?", "Page: I did.", "Sheldon: Very well. Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?", "Page: I\u2019m afraid not. Is there anything else?", "Sheldon: Is there anything else? Where would you like to start? He refuses to pay fines when he\u2019s overdue with books I lend him. He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman. He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, just as good as the first one. If that\u2019s not irresponsible, I don\u2019t know what is.", "Page: The Mars Rover?", "Sheldon: Did I say Mars Rover?", "Page: You did.", "Sheldon: That was actually a poorly chosen example, as it had nothing to do with me.", "Page: Yes, well, let\u2019s talk about it anyway.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t want to. Not that my disinclination to discuss the topic should be interpreted as evidence of Howard Wolowitz\u2019s culpability in the destruction of government property worth millions of dollars.", "Page: Thank you, Dr. Cooper. I think I have all I need.", "Sheldon: Oh, good. I was afraid you were going to fixate on that Mars Rover incident.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: Hey, buddies. Guess who didn\u2019t get security clearance to work on the giant space laser?", "Leonard: What happened?", "Howard: Apparently, the background interviews didn\u2019t go well. You guys wouldn\u2019t know anything about that, would you?", "Raj: Well, actually, I may have gotten a little tipsy when I talked to her.", "Leonard: And I may have hit on her a little bit.", "Raj: I may have thrown up rum cake on her shoes.", "Howard: I see. Well, it\u2019s good to know, when I need you guys, I can always count on you to step up and ruin everything.", "Leonard: I feel awful.", "Raj: Ah, me, too.", "Leonard: To tell you the truth, I thought if anyone was going to screw things up for Howard, it\u2019d be Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Well, your expectations have been subverted. Aha.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: What are you doing up?", "Sheldon: Sleep eludes me, Leonard.", "Leonard: Really? Maybe sleep has met you before.", "Sheldon: Mockery? That\u2019s all you have to offer?", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry. Why can\u2019t you sleep?", "Sheldon: Who knows? I haven\u2019t watched any scary movies recently. I\u2019m no longer obsessing over why the predicted mass of the quantum vacuum has little effect on the expansion of the universe. And it\u2019s been weeks since I took that accidental sip of Red Bull.", "Leonard: Did something happen today that\u2019s bothering you?", "Sheldon: Well, I did mention the Mars Rover incident to that FBI agent and probably cost Howard his security clearance.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: But why should that keep me up?", "Leonard: Because you feel guilty?", "Sheldon: Interesting. So you\u2019re saying my insomnia is caused by a guilty conscience.", "Leonard: Actually, you don\u2019t have insomnia. You\u2019re sleeping now.", "Sheldon: Excuse me?", "Leonard: You\u2019re having a guilt-ridden dream.", "Sheldon: Do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis?", "Leonard: How about that Gorn sitting on the couch?", "Sheldon: That seems fairly conclusive. (In his bed) No, Gorn, no. That\u2019s where I sit.", "Scene: Agent Page\u2019s Office.", "Sheldon: Thank you for agreeing to see me, Agent Page.", "Page: Thank you for filing a complaint with my superior, Dr. Cooper. I understand you want to recant your statement about Howard Wolowitz.", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Page: Was your statement untrue?", "Sheldon: No.", "Page: Then I\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t withdraw it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t recall you saying no backsies.", "Page: Is there anything else?", "Sheldon: Yes. I\u2019d like to offer a laudatory statement about Howard\u2019s many excellent qualities that I believe will tip the scales back in his favour. Howard Joel Wolowitz. H is for honesty, of which he has much. O\u2019s for outstanding, which he is such. W\u2019s for witty, he\u2019s quick with a joke. A\u2019s for artistic, his ability\u2026", "Page: I\u2019m sorry, Dr. Cooper, this matter is already closed.", "Sheldon: But I still have rd Joel Wolowitz left to go.", "Page: It\u2019s closed.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t understand why you people are picking on my friend, Howard, when there are much more serious security threats to pursue. For instance, when I first met Leonard, he was on the verge of giving away rocket secrets to a North Korean spy, and not one agent ever investigated that.", "Page: This is Leonard Hofstadter?", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s a different Leonard. He\u2019s Chinese, red hair, six fingers. Good-bye.", "Scene: A corridor at the university.", "Sheldon: Raj. Have you seen Howard?", "Raj: I think he\u2019s eating lunch. Uh, Sheldon, I want you to meet Neil deGrasse Tyson from the Hayden Planetarium in New York.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m quite familiar with Dr. Tyson. He\u2019s responsible for the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. I liked Pluto. Ergo I do not like you.", "Dr Tyson: But I actually didn\u2019t demote Pluto. That was a vote of the International Astronomical Union.", "Sheldon: If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we\u2019d all have a merry Christmas. Think about that, Dr. Tyson.", "Dr Tyson: Is that the guy you were telling me about?", "Raj: Oh, yeah.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Sheldon: Howard. The person at fault for you not getting a security clearance is me.", "Howard: You?", "Sheldon: Yes, but before you get upset, I want you to know I went to the FBI and retracted my statement.", "Howard: And they were okay with that?", "Sheldon: No. If anything, I made it worse. In any case, I have been riddled with guilt, which is causing Gorn-infested REM sleep. So, I\u2019m here now to say I\u2019m sorry.", "Howard: Are you kidding me? You\u2019ve set my career back at least two years, and you think you can make it right with I\u2019m sorry?", "Sheldon: Yes. I followed the social protocol. I attempted to right the wrong, and when I failed to do so I delivered a heartfelt apology. Now you say apology accepted, and I will offer you a one-time-only high five.", "Howard: Your apology is not accepted.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re tricking me. It really is, isn\u2019t it?", "Howard: Leave me alone, Sheldon.", "Dr Tyson: Dr. Cooper, I just wanted you to know I\u2019m sorry for the role I played in the Pluto matter.", "Sheldon: Oh, shut up.", "Scene: The bar of the Cheesecake Factory.", "Penny: Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: What are you doing here?", "Sheldon: I have troubles, Penny. I\u2019ve come to pour them out to the sympathetic ear of the local barkeep.", "Penny: You know, they have a really nice bar over at the Olive Garden.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t like the Olive Garden. They treat me like family.", "Penny: Okay, Sheldon. What can I get you?", "Sheldon: Alcohol.", "Penny: Could you be a little more specific?", "Sheldon: Ethyl alcohol. 40 millilitres.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry, honey, I don\u2019t know millilitres.", "Sheldon: Ah. Blame President James \u201cJimmy\u201d Carter. He started America on a path to the metric system but then just gave up. He wonders why he was a one-term president.", "Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Would you say that\u2019s about 40 milliliters?", "Sheldon: More or less.", "Penny: Great. (Drinks the tequila) Now, where were we?", "Sheldon: I believe you were about to ask me to choose a cocktail. Fortunately, thanks to computer-savvy alcoholics, there\u2019s an app for that. Let\u2019s see. Harvey Wallbanger. Eh. Sex on the Beach. I hardly think so. Rob Roy, Silk Slipper, Mad Hatter. Ooh! I\u2019ll have a Rosewater Ricky.", "Penny: A what?", "Sheldon: You\u2019ll need pitted, brandied cherries, gin, rosewater, angostura bitters and overproofed rum. Now, first, dust the cherries with sugar, then spray them with a mixture of rum and bitters. Then ignite the rum, caramel\u2026", "Penny (pouring out a shot of tequila): Here you go, one Rosewater Ricky.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s not how it looks in the picture.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, you know, every bartender makes it differently. Why don\u2019t you give it a try.", "Sheldon: All right. To the metric system. (Knocks back drink. Spits it all back into glass.) I can\u2019t taste the cherries.", "Penny: All right. Sheldon, what\u2019s on your mind?", "Sheldon: I wronged Howard, and he won\u2019t accept my apology.", "Penny: Oh, right, that. Yes, Leonard told me. Sorry, honey.", "Sheldon: Penny, you face failure on a daily basis. How do you cope?", "Penny: I drink.", "Sheldon: To drinking. (Knocks back drink and spits it out again.) Nope. Oh, if only there were some way to force Howard to accept my apology so I could escape this miasma of guilt.", "Penny: You know, sometimes stuff just happens, and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. For example, Lisa Peterson hasn\u2019t talked to me since the 11th grade, because no matter how much you apologize, you can\u2019t go back and un-dry-hump someone\u2019s boyfriend.", "Sheldon: I see. You\u2019re saying I\u2019m facing Starfleet Academy\u2019s unwinnable command scenario, the Kobayashi Maru.", "Penny: Exactly. Sometimes you can\u2019t win.", "Sheldon: Captain Kirk won.", "Penny: Kirk cheated.", "Sheldon: Impressive that you know that. It\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019m actually having this conversation with you.", "Penny: Right there with you.", "Sheldon: Kirk beat the Kobayashi Maru by reprogramming the simulator. That\u2019s it.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll reprogram Howard.", "Penny: What? Sheldon, you can\u2019t reprogram people.", "Sheldon: No, you can\u2019t reprogram people. To James Tiberius Kirk. (Drinks. Leaves. Comes back and spits it out again.)", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Sheldon: Hello, all.", "Raj: Hello.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Howard, you\u2019re feeling better about me today, aren\u2019t you?", "Howard: Not really.", "Sheldon: Yes, you are. I\u2019m using neurolinguistic programming to modify your thought patterns.", "Howard: Oh. Go away, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s a nine ninety five e-book down the drain.", "Raj: What\u2019s in the bag?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s for Howard.", "Howard: Oh. Sheldon, you can\u2019t fix this with gifts.", "Sheldon: Nevertheless, I\u2019ve hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.", "Howard: You\u2019re giving me a couch cushion?", "Sheldon: No. The cushion is merely symbolic. I\u2019m giving you my spot on the couch.", "Howard: But you love that spot.", "Sheldon: No. I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater. It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe. And now it\u2019s yours.", "Raj: Oh, my God, dude. Now you have to forgive him.", "Howard: All right. Apology accepted.", "Sheldon: High five. Not too hard. Thank you.", "Raj: I haven\u2019t cried like this since Toy Story 3.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Howard: I got to tell you, Sheldon, I understand why you chose this spot. I mean, the temperature is good, but there\u2019s no draft. I can see the television, but I can still talk to\u2026", "Sheldon: I changed my mind. Get out of my spot.", "Penny: How long?", "Leonard: 94 seconds."]}
