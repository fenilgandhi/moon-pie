{"series": "4", "episode": "16", "transcript": ["Episode begins with a \u201cPreviously on\u201d sequence before first scene.", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: What\u2019s so funny?", "Bernadette: Nothing. Just thinking about the noises people make during sex.", "Howard: I do sometimes get a bit carried away, don\u2019t I?", "Bernadette: It\u2019s cute. You sound a little like a drunken monkey. Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!", "Howard: You know it\u2019s meant as a compliment.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s how I take it.", "Howard: This is perfect. I hope this moment never ends.", "Bernadette: Me too.", "Howard: Well, gotta go.", "Bernadette: Oh! Already? Why don\u2019t you stay over?", "Howard: Well, I\u2019d love to, but you know my mother needs me in the morning.", "Bernadette: Please, I think the woman can manage to put a wig on by herself.", "Howard: It\u2019s not just the wig. It\u2019s pinning her hair up, drawing on her eyebrows. It\u2019s a two-person job.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s just, when you leave right after we make love, it makes me feel cheap.", "Howard: Oh, honey, I\u2019m sorry. What can I do?", "Bernadette: Stay.", "Howard: Okay. Like, what, another five, ten minutes?", "Bernadette: Go home.", "Howard: Your call.", "Bernadette: Howard, have you ever considered us living together?", "Howard: Boy, I don\u2019t know. You, me, Ma living under the same roof?", "Bernadette: No, I mean just you and me. You can move in here, or we can find a place.", "Howard: I\u2019ve got a better solution.", "Bernadette: What?", "Howard: We wait for my mom\u2019s heart to explode from all the salt she eats. Then we just stick her in the ground, flip her mattress and move into the big bedroom.", "Bernadette: Great.", "Howard: Look at us planning a future together.", "Scene: Outside Howard\u2019s house.", "Mrs Wolowitz (voice): Who\u2019s there? Are you a sex criminal?", "Howard: Sex criminals don\u2019t have keys, Ma.", "Mrs Wolowitz: Where were you so late?", "Howard: I was out with Bernadette.", "Mrs Wolowitz: I know what that means, I watch Dr. Phil. I hope to God you used a condom!", "Howard: I\u2019m not having this conversation with you, Ma!", "Mrs Wolowitz: God forbid you get one of those new fancy sex diseases!", "Howard: Nobody has a disease!", "Mrs Wolowitz: I hope not. I share a toilet with you. Is that what you want? To give your mother herpes?", "Howard: That\u2019s it. I don\u2019t have to take this. Good luck with your eyebrows in the morning!", "Mrs Wolowitz: Who\u2019s there? Are you a sex criminal?", "Howard: I\u2019m still leaving! I just forgot my Claritin.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Hey, what\u2019s up?", "Howard: I need a place to crash.", "Leonard: Uh, sure. Why?", "Howard: Big fight with my mother.", "Leonard: Still arguing over which CSI is the best?", "Howard: No, we agreed they all have their merits. This was about Bernadette.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: Howard\u2019s gonna sleep here tonight. He had a fight with his mother.", "Sheldon: Did you offer him a hot beverage?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Leonard, social protocol states when a friend is upset, you offer them a hot beverage, such as tea.", "Howard: Tea does sound nice.", "Sheldon: You heard the man, Leonard. And while you\u2019re at it, I\u2019m upset that we have an unannounced houseguest, so make me cocoa. Point of inquiry, given that Leonard is your secondary friend and Koothrappali is your primary friend, why didn\u2019t you seek refuge under his roof?", "Howard: There\u2019s no room. His sister is staying with him.", "Leonard: Wait, wait. What?", "Sheldon: Cocoa, Leonard. Focus. I\u2019m down in the dumps here.", "Leonard: Priya\u2019s in town?", "Howard: Yeah, some work thing. Anyway, my mother seems to think that Bernadette\u2026", "Leonard: Hold on. When did Priya get here?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. A couple of days ago. The thing is, Bernadette doesn\u2019t like that I have to take care of my mother, and my mother doesn\u2019t trust Bernadette.", "Leonard: Yeah, that\u2019s a real pickle. Bye.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t worry. As your tertiary friend, I am prepared to step in and comfort you.", "Howard: That\u2019s not really necessary.", "Sheldon: No, no. I\u2019ll finish making the tea, while you narcissistically ramble on about whatever\u2019s troubling you.", "Howard: Thanks.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s what tertiary friends are for.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s Apartment. Leonard knocks on the door. ", "Raj (inside): Who is it?", "Leonard: It\u2019s Leonard.", "Raj: You can\u2019t come in.", "Leonard: I just want to talk to her.", "Raj: I forbid it.", "Priya: Open the door, Rajesh.", "Raj: You heard me. I forbidded it.", "Priya: Forbidded it?", "Raj: Forbaded it?", "Priya: Get out of the way. What are you doing here?", "Leonard: What are you doing here?", "Priya: I have business in Los Angeles.", "Leonard: Why didn\u2019t you call?", "Raj: Clearly, she was sending you a message to take a hike, Mike.", "Priya: I\u2019m sorry. I thought about calling, but I just wasn\u2019t sure if seeing you was such a good idea.", "Leonard: I know. Last time I came on too strong. Can we talk in private?", "Raj: No!", "Priya: Sure.", "Raj: It\u2019s completely inappropriate for a single woman to entertain a man in private. If you insist on talking, you must do it on the couch! All right, you may talk in the bedroom, but I want this door to remain open! All right, just this once you may close the door. But keep in mind I\u2019ll be right out here monitoring the situation! (Dials phone) Oh, damn it. Leonard, when you get this message, call me. (Dials again) Priya, this is your brother. When you get this, tell Leonard to check his voicemail.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.", "Sheldon: Would you be sleeping over again this evening? Because you\u2019re welcome to.", "Howard: That\u2019s very nice of you, but I made other plans.", "Sheldon: Well, just keep in mind that should you ever need a slightly apathetic tertiary friend, I stand at the ready.", "Priya: Hi, Howard. Hi, Sheldon.", "Howard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Raj: Why are you holding hands? I forbid you to hold hands.", "Priya: Rajesh, you know Leonard and I spent the night together.", "Raj: Yeah, but you were just sleeping, because I forboded you to have sex.", "Leonard: The word is forbade.", "Raj: Are you sure? That doesn\u2019t sound right.", "Priya: Listen, Rajesh, Leonard and I have decided to see each other again, and you don\u2019t get to tell me who I can and can\u2019t have a relationship with.", "Sheldon: Actually, he can. The Hindu Code of Manu is very clear in these matters. If a woman\u2019s father is not around, the duty of controlling her base desires falls to the closest male member of her family, in this case, Raj. The code also states that if she disobeys, she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases. If true, that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard.", "Raj: There it is, Priya. We\u2019re Indian. We believe this stuff.", "Priya: I think it also says that if you eat beef, you need to live with cows for three months and drink their urine.", "Raj: Some of it makes sense, some of it\u2019s crazy. My point is, you can\u2019t go out with Leonard.", "Penny (arriving): Who can\u2019t go out with Leonard?", "Raj: My sister.", "Leonard: Penny, this is Raj\u2019s sister, Priya.", "Priya: It\u2019s very nice to meet you.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, you, too.", "Sheldon: Priya, if you\u2019re experiencing any tension or awkwardness, it may stem from the fact that Leonard and Penny used to, if I may quote Howard, do the dance with no pants.", "Penny: Sheldon!", "Leonard: Really?", "Howard: Hey, Bernadette, can I talk to you for a second?", "Bernadette: Sure.", "Raj: Penny, you became disenchanted with Leonard as a lover. Would you please tell my sister why?", "Howard: Listen, my mom\u2019s going to Palm Springs to visit her sister. That\u2019s two whole nights in a row I can sleep over with you all the way to morning. Unless the desert air dries out her sinuses, in which case I\u2019ll have to schlep out there with the big humidifier.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s it? That\u2019s your big solution to all of our problems? If your mom\u2019s nose holds up, we get two nights together?", "Howard: Isn\u2019t that great?", "Bernadette: No, it\u2019s not great. You need to make a choice. Me or your mother.", "Howard: Oh, uh\u2026", "Bernadette: Wrong answer.", "Howard: No, wait. You didn\u2019t let me finish.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m listening.", "Howard: Uh\u2026", "Bernadette: Agh!", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. (groans)", "Amy: I came as quickly as I could.", "Penny: Okay. Why?", "Amy: To comfort you, of course. Sheldon told me about Leonard dating Rajesh\u2019s sister. So I high-tailed it over here to pick up the pieces of your broken heart.", "Penny: Amy, I\u2019m fine.", "Amy: You don\u2019t have to be strong for me. Now let\u2019s talk about Priya, that man-stealing bitch.", "Penny: What?", "Amy: In situations like this, best girlfriends are often catty about the other woman. Rawr.", "Penny: Really, I am not upset about Leonard and Priya.", "Amy: Oh. Then perhaps you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. Your former boyfriend has replaced you with what appears to be a very suitable mate. Arguably much more suitable than you.", "Penny: Oh. Well, good for him. Hey, what do you mean, more suitable?", "Amy: Well, granted, Penny, your secondary sexual characteristics are reasonably bodacious. But Priya is highly educated, she\u2019s an accomplished professional, and she comes from the culture that literally wrote the book on neat ways to have sex. Whereas you, on the other hand, are a community college dropout who comes from the culture that wrote the book on tipping cows.", "Penny: Yeah. Okay, I got it. I got it. So, what is all that stuff?", "Amy: This is a portable electroencephalogram. I\u2019m doing research on emotions and brain activity. So when you start crying, I can see which region of the brain is activated. Then I\u2019m going to stimulate the analogous area in the brain of a rhesus monkey and see if he cries. Cool, huh?", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s apartment. Howard knocks on door.", "Howard: I choose you.", "Bernadette: Really?", "Howard: Yep. I moved out of my mother\u2019s house. Cord is cut. I\u2019m all yours.", "Bernadette: What did she say when you told her?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. She hasn\u2019t responded to my email yet.", "Bernadette: This is so great. I love you, Howard.", "Howard: I love you, too. So what\u2019s for dinner?", "Bernadette: Well, I don\u2019t really have much of anything in the house.", "Howard: That\u2019s fine. Why don\u2019t we go fool around in our bedroom? And then you can go shopping.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: I thought maybe after we eat, we could see an early movie.", "Priya: I\u2019d love that.", "Leonard: I love the way you say, I\u2019d love that.", "Raj: She says it the same way I do. I\u2019d love that. Everybody in India says it that way. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "Priya: Rajesh, don\u2019t be a child.", "Raj: I\u2019m not being a child. Leonard, I swear to God, if your sister ever comes to town, I shall have my way with her.", "Leonard: My sister\u2019s 38 and married.", "Raj: All the more shame that will fall upon the house of Hofstadter.", "Penny: Ooh, I thought I smelled pizza.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s remarkable. If pepperoni were an explosive substance, you could replace German shepherds at our nation\u2019s airports.", "Priya: Hi. Penny, right?", "Penny: Oh, yes. Hi, hi. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you had company. I don\u2019t want to impose.", "Sheldon: No, no. It\u2019s not an imposition. At this point, in our ecosystem, you are akin to the plover, a small scavenging bird that eats extra food from between the teeth of crocodiles. Please, fly into our open maw, and have at it.", "Penny: If I had more than a box of baking soda in my refrigerator, I wouldn\u2019t have to take that.", "Amy: Hi, bestie.", "Penny: Hi. So, um, Priya, you\u2019re a lawyer, right?", "Priya: I know. Pretty boring, huh?", "Leonard: Oh, come on. It\u2019s not boring at all. She\u2019s currently helping set up a secondary derivative market which would allow overseas car firms to hedge their investments against potential advancements in battery technology. Hmm?", "Priya: Thank you, Leonard. That doesn\u2019t make it sound boring at all.", "Amy: So, how you holding up?", "Penny: I\u2019m fine.", "Amy: Oh, who are you kidding? She\u2019s breathtaking.", "Priya: So, Penny, Leonard tells me you\u2019re an actress. That must be pretty exciting.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s real great. Today I drove to Van Nuys for an audition I thought was going to be for a cat food commercial. Turned out to be porn.", "Sheldon: Did you get the part?", "Penny: I didn\u2019t do the audition.", "Sheldon: Given the state of your career, can you really afford to be picky?", "Priya: I took acting classes when I was at Cambridge. I loved it. We did Taming of the Shrew.", "Leonard: Oh, wow. I love Taming of the Shrew. I did a paper on it in high school. Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting? In his tail.", "Priya: In his tongue.", "Leonard: Whose tongue?", "Priya: Yours, if you talk of tails, and so farewell.", "Leonard: What, with my tongue in your tail?", "Amy: I\u2019m regretting my earlier cattiness. She is an absolute delight.", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. ", "Bernadette: Wow.", "Howard: Wow, indeed.", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re finally living together.", "Howard: Yeah. You know what would make this moment perfect?", "Bernadette: What?", "Howard: A little snack. You got any string cheese?", "Bernadette: No. I, I might have some cheddar.", "Howard: Not as good. You can\u2019t make strings with it. Remind me to put it on your shopping list.", "Bernadette: Okay.", "Howard: You have hypo-allergenic detergent?", "Bernadette: No.", "Howard: Better put it on the list. If you wash my underwear with regular soap, I get little red bumps on my tuchus.", "Bernadette: Wait a second. I\u2019m doing your laundry?", "Howard: Well, honey, it\u2019s not gonna do itself. Oh, before I forget, tomorrow morning, you\u2019re driving me to the dentist.", "Bernadette: I have to take you?", "Howard: You don\u2019t have to take me. You get to take me.", "Bernadette: Wait a minute. Are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist?", "Howard: It\u2019s not weird. There\u2019s lots of kids there with their moms.", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t believe this.", "Howard: What? It\u2019s fun. If I have no cavities, afterwards, we go out for a treat.", "Bernadette: All right, Howard, let\u2019s get something straight right now. I\u2019m not going to be your mother.", "Howard: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where did that come from?", "Scene: Howard\u2019s house. ", "\u00a0", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Who\u2019s that? Is it a sex criminal?", "Howard: Nobody wants to do that to you, Ma.", "Mrs Wolowitz: Where were you?", "Howard: Didn\u2019t you read my email?", "Mrs Wolowitz: You know I can\u2019t turn on that ferkakta computer. I left you some brisket on the kitchen counter.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Mrs Wolowitz: Remember to floss after. We have the dentist in the morning!", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "\u00a0", "Penny: Oh, hey. What\u2019s up?", "Amy: I just wanted to check in on you.", "Penny: Why?", "Amy: It seems like the appropriate thing to do when one\u2019s best friend finds herself replaced by a smart, beautiful woman with the smouldering sexuality of a crouched Bengal tiger.", "Penny: I already told you, I\u2019m okay with it. I mean, if anything, I\u2019m quite pleased (starting to blub) that Leonard has found someone (starting to blub) that makes him so happy.", "Amy: It\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Amy: Now, let\u2019s get these electrodes attached and see what\u2019s going on in that pretty little noggin of yours.", "Penny: Okay.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: I smell Chinese food.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s actually Thai. You\u2019re slipping.", "Penny: Are Leonard and Priya here?", "Sheldon: They went to Catalina for the weekend.", "Penny: Oh. Where\u2019s Raj?", "Sheldon: At home, forbidding it.", "Penny: How about Howard?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m given to understand his mother grounded him for running away.", "Penny: Oh, okay. Well, I guess it\u2019s just the two of us, huh?", "Sheldon: Actually, it\u2019s the three of us.", "Amy (on webcam): What up, bestie? Good news. Thanks to you, I was able to make a rhesus monkey cry like a disgraced televangelist.", "Penny: Great.", "Amy: So, you feeling better?", "Penny: Not really.", "Amy: Sheldon, you have a guest who\u2019s upset.", "Sheldon: Right. I\u2019ll make tea.", "Penny: Oh, sweetie, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want tea.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not optional."]}
