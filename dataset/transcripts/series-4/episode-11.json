Infinite Sheldon.", "Leonard: Infinite Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Yes, Infinite Sheldon defeats all other cards and does not violate the rule against homemade cards because I made it at work.", "Leonard: Do you understand why people don\u2019t want to play with you?", "Sheldon: No, although it\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been pondering since preschool.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Zack: Hey.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hey, your copy of Science magazine was in my mailbox.", "Leonard: Oh, thanks.", "Penny: Mm-hmm.", "Zack: Check it out, all about planets this month.", "Leonard: That\u2019s an atom.", "Zack: Agree to disagree. That\u2019s what I love about science, there\u2019s no one right answer.", "Leonard: So, you and Zack again, huh?", "Penny: Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.", "Zack: Were we here earlier?", "Penny: Okay, we should, we should go.", "Zack: Ah, not yet. I want to talk science with the science dudes.", "Howard: Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you. What do you want to talk about, rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?", "Zack: You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel. Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it\u2019ll just come back to life.", "Sheldon: Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts? Because you might have been watching Nickelodeon.", "Zack: No, I\u2019m almost sure that it was the Discovery Channel. It was a great show. They also said dolphins might be smarter than people.", "Leonard: They might be smarter than some people.", "Zack: Well, maybe we can do an experiment to find out.", "Sheldon: Oh, that\u2019s easy enough. We\u2019d need a large tank of water, a hoop to jump through, and a bucket of whatever bite-sized treats you find tasty.", "Zack: I don\u2019t get it.", "Leonard: A dolphin might.", "Zack: Oh, I see. You guys are inferring that I\u2019m stupid.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s not correct. We were implying it. You then inferred it.", "Zack: Let\u2019s go.", "Penny: You know, for a group of guys who claim they spent most of their lives being bullied, you can be real jerks. Shame on all of you. (Closes door)", "Raj: What the hell did I do?", "Penny (Opens door again): You laughed.", "Scene: The same.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: You think Penny\u2019s right? Were we bullying Zack?", "Howard: No, I know bullying. He left here unswirlied and his ass crack was underpants-free.", "Raj: And nobody drew a penis on his forehead.", "Leonard: That happened to you?", "Raj: First day of cricket camp. They drew it so the testicles were my eyes.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, I think we might owe the guy an apology.", "Howard: So go apologize.", "Leonard: Why me?", "Howard: You started it, we just piled on.", "Leonard: What would I even say?", "Sheldon: Zack, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stupid. Have a Milk Dud.", "Raj: A Milk Dud?", "Sheldon: Yeah, Milk Duds, with their self-deprecating name and remarkably mild flavour, are the most apologetic of the boxed candies.", "Leonard: I got a better idea. We\u2019re all responsible. I say we all go. Come on, who\u2019s with me? Free comic books to anyone who comes with me. I might get punched. You really want to miss that?", "Raj: Junior Mints are pretty apologetic.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re embarrassing yourself.", "Scene: At Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks three times. ", "Sheldon: Penny.", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: Yeah, we came to talk to Zack. Hey, Zack.", "Zack: What do you want?", "Leonard: Listen, uh, the stuff we were saying before, we were just kidding around.", "Zack: No, you weren\u2019t. You were making fun of me.", "Leonard: Come on, that\u2019s what we do. We give each other a hard time. Hey, Sheldon, you look like a praying mantis.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s very hurtful.", "Leonard: See?", "Zack: I don\u2019t know, it still wasn\u2019t very nice.", "Sheldon: Milk Dud?", "Zack: Oh, I love Milk Duds. Okay, we\u2019re cool.", "Sheldon (to Raj): Junior Mints.", "Zack: You guys want to come in and have a beer?", "Leonard: Uh, we\u2019re on our way to the comic book store.", "Howard: Leonard\u2019s buying.", "Zack: Really? I haven\u2019t been to a comic book store in literally a million years.", "Sheldon: Literally? Literally a million years?", "Leonard: Don\u2019t.", "Zack: You want to go with \u2019em?", "Penny: No.", "Zack: Okay, see you later.", "Penny: Wait, w-w-wait-wait-wait, you\u2019re ditching me to go look at comic books?", "Zack: Are you mad at me?", "Penny: I\u2019m not happy.", "Zack: Milk Dud?", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Zack: Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies?", "Sheldon: In the bedrooms of ten-year-old girls, where they belong.", "Zack: Oh, no, you\u2019re thinking old-school Archie. It\u2019s much more sophisticated now. Like, there\u2019s two universes, and Archie\u2019s married to Betty in one and Veronica in the other. Midge is even breaking up with Moose.", "Raj: No.", "Zack: About time, right?", "Stuart: Hey.", "Zack: Hey.", "Stuart: You guys finally chip in for a bodyguard?", "Leonard: Uh, no. Oh, this is Zack. He\u2019s a friend of ours. Zack, this is Stuart. He owns the store.", "Zack: Wow, lucky you.", "Stuart: Yeah, I work 70 hours a week and average a dollar sixty five an hour.", "Zack: Sweet.", "Stuart: Is that sarcasm?", "Howard: Uh, no, it\u2019s an indictment of the American education system.", "Raj: The Archies are over here.", "Zack: Yippee.", "Stuart: So are you guys coming to my New Year\u2019s Eve costume party?", "Sheldon: Of course. We\u2019re coming as the Justice League of America.", "Howard: Switching it up from last year when we came as the Justice League of America.", "Sheldon: To that point, it occurs to me that we might have an opportunity to finally snare Best Group Costume if we shore up our weak link, which is clearly Leonard as Superman.", "Leonard: Hey, I got new boots this year. Guaranteed to add three inches.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s sad. Let\u2019s ask ourselves, is there anyone we know who would make a more manly and convincing son of Krypton?", "Stuart: Than than Leonard in high-heeled boots? Howard\u2019s mother in high-heeled boots?", "Sheldon: I was thinking specifically of the gentleman over there moving his lips as he enjoys the latest exploits of Betty and Veronica.", "Leonard: Zack?", "Howard: He is the only person we know with actual muscles.", "Leonard: You can\u2019t replace me with Zack.", "Sheldon: Why not? Penny did it.", "Howard: Yeah, she seems happier. Why wouldn\u2019t we be?", "Zack: Score. I got an Archie, Betty and Veronica, and a Jughead. All set for my weekend number twos.", "Sheldon: Congratulations. Zack, how would you like to be Superman?", "Zack: I don\u2019t know, sounds like a lot of responsibility.", "Scene: The stairwell. ", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Fine, if Zack\u2019s going to be Superman, I want to be Green Lantern.", "Raj: But I\u2019m Green Lantern.", "Leonard: You can be Aquaman.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want to be Aquaman. He sucks. He sucks underwater. He sucks fish pee.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, I believe Aquaman uses his telepathic powers to request the fish do their business elsewhere.", "Zack: Hey, babe.", "Penny: I\u2019m still mad at you.", "Zack: Well, you won\u2019t be when you hear the great news.", "Penny: What great news?", "Zack: We\u2019re going to a costume party at the comic book store on New Year\u2019s Eve, and you get to be Wonder Woman.", "Sheldon: Complete with bulletproof bracelets and lasso of truth. Invisible plane sold separately.", "Penny: Wait, why me? Wh-Why can\u2019t your girlfriend be Wonder Woman?", "Howard: She and her lab team are under quarantine. Seems at the Christmas party they were doing Jell-O shots out of petri dishes that used to contain yellow fever.", "Penny: Okay, what about your friend Amy?", "Sheldon: Amy Farrah Fowler doesn\u2019t believe in wearing costumes. She isn\u2019t the free spirit I am.", "Penny: Okay, well, forget it. I\u2019m not spending my New Year\u2019s Eve at a comic book store wearing a Wonder Woman costume.", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): He says he\u2019ll wear it if you\u2019ll be Aquaman.", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard is dressed as Green Lantern, Sheldon as The Flash. ", "Leonard: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: We\u2019re going to be late. I\u2019m pacing nervously.", "Leonard: You\u2019re jogging.", "Sheldon: This is how the Flash paces.", "Leonard; Just chill out, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not Sheldon. I\u2019m the Flash. And now I\u2019m going to the Grand Canyon to scream in frustration. I\u2019m back.", "Howard: I\u2019m Batman.", "Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. The real caped crusader calls his crime-fighting cohorts when he\u2019s running late.", "Howard: I had to walk. I couldn\u2019t get Raj on the back of my scooter.", "Raj: I\u2019ve said this before, and I\u2019ll say it again. Aquaman sucks.", "Zack: Look up in the sky. It\u2019s a bird. It\u2019s a plane. I forget the rest.", "Penny: All right. Let\u2019s get this thing over with.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. But in what universe is Wonder Woman blonde?", "Howard: Relax. No one\u2019s going to be looking at her hair. Ow! I mean, ow.", "Zack: Hold on. The costume came with a black wig. Where is it, babe?", "Penny: No. I\u2019m not wearing it. It looks stupid.", "Zack: Come on. We\u2019re trying to win a contest here.", "Penny: Forget it. I\u2019m not wearing the wig.", "Zack: Penny, there\u2019s no I in Justice League.", "Howard: Well, actually.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t. He\u2019s making our case.", "Zack: Okay, babe. Uh, kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends.", "Penny: Okay. You know what? I changed my mind. I\u2019m not going.", "Raj: Looks like someone else is going to have to be Wonder Woman.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s door. ", "Zack: Babe, open up.", "Penny: I\u2019m not talking to you.", "Zack: Then who are you talking to? Babe?", "Sheldon:\u00a0 (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny, (Knock) Penny.", "Penny: What the hell is wrong with you?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m the Flash. I just knocked 30,000 times.", "Penny: Okay. What do you want, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: I understand why you\u2019re upset.", "Penny: Really?", "Sheldon: Yes. You\u2019re afraid that costume makes you look fat.", "Penny: No. Wait, wait, does it?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t worry. Wonder Woman was an Amazon. And Amazons tend to be very beefy gals.", "Penny: Good-bye, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: But they\u2019re not blonde, so put on your wig. Hello?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Stupid Aquaman.", "Leonard: If it makes you feel any better, when I was dating Penny, she used to flip out on me all the time.", "Zack: Whoa. You dated Penny?", "Leonard: She didn\u2019t tell you?", "Zack: She told me she dated a guy named Leonard. Who would have thought it was you?", "Leonard: Who else would it be?", "Zack: I don\u2019t know. Somebody bigger and, yeah, sure. Why not you?", "Sheldon: I may have failed.", "Howard: Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman.", "Zack: I don\u2019t want to go without Penny.", "Raj: Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we\u2019ve got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight.", "Sheldon: Obviously, we\u2019re no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes.", "Raj: Ooh, I call Kermit.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m Kermit. You\u2019re Scooter.", "Raj: Oh, man. Scooter sucks. He\u2019s the Aquaman of the Muppet Babies.", "Howard: No, we can still make this work. Leonard, you talk to Penny.", "Leonard: What makes you think I can convince her?", "Howard: You got her to have sex with you. Obviously, your superpower is brainwashing.", "Leonard: Okay, let me see if I understand this. You want me to convince my ex-girlfriend to go to a costume party with her new boyfriend just so we can win a stupid prize?", "Sheldon: Yes. And make her wear the black wig. Good luck.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Knocking.", "Penny: Go away, Sheldon.", "Leonard: It\u2019s Leonard.", "Penny: Oh. Go away, Leonard.", "Leonard; Come on, let me just talk to you.", "Penny: It\u2019s open.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: I\u2019m not going to that party, Leonard.", "Leonard: Okay, listen. You don\u2019t have to wear the wig. At this party, we\u2019re gonna win first prize just by showing up with a girl.", "Penny: It\u2019s not the wig.", "Leonard: Did I do something? I mean, I tried to be friends with Zack, like you said, which believe me, was difficult, given how you and me used to be, you know, you and me, and now you and him are you and him.", "Penny: Okay, look. We\u2019re not really me and him.", "Leonard: Then what are you?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. I only started seeing Zack again so I wouldn\u2019t be alone on New Year\u2019s Eve. How pathetic is that?", "Leonard: Not as pathetic as dressing up like this and going to a comic book store on New Year\u2019s Eve.", "Penny: You make a cute Green Arrow.", "Leonard: Green Lantern.", "Penny: Like there\u2019s a difference.", "Leonard: There\u2019s a big difference. Arrow. Lantern.", "Penny: Whatever. Look, if Zack and I had just gone to a regular club or a party, it would have been fine, but this, with the costumes, and you.", "Leonard: What about me?", "Penny: Nothing. Let\u2019s go to the party. (Puts on wig) How do I look?", "Leonard: Um, I guarantee you\u2019ll be the prettiest girl there.", "Howard (outside the door): Okay, the good news is, we have a Wonder Woman.", "Sheldon: Oh.", "Zack: Yes.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s the bad news?", "Howard: Superman probably isn\u2019t getting laid tonight.", "Zack: Aw, damn.", "Scene: The party. ", "\u00a0", "Stuart: And the award for best group costume goes to Justice League of America number three!", "Sheldon: Thank you! Thank you so much!", "Stuart: Okay. Okay, ten seconds to midnight.", "All: Ten, nine, eight\u2026", "Sheldon: No, wait! I have a speech.", "All: Seven, six\u2026", "Sheldon: Stop counting!", "All: Five, four, three\u2026", "Sheldon: This is my moment, dag nab it!", "All: Two, one! Happy New Year!", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not going to say another word until you people settle down. I\u2019m waiting.", "Scene: The street. ", "Zack: That was a great party. We should dress like this all the time.", "Penny: Are you high?", "Leonard: You\u2019re being a bully.", "Howard: Check it out. Those guys are breaking into that car.", "Leonard: What should we do?", "Sheldon: We\u2019re the Justice League of America. There\u2019s only one thing we can do. Turn around and slowly walk away.", "Zack (after a moment\u2019s thought): Nah. Hold up.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Look, I know our winter thermostat setting is 72 degrees, but I\u2019m a little warm, so I\u2019m going to turn it down.", "Sheldon (as The Flash, runs to the Grand Canyon): Good Lord, how you frustrate me, Leonard Hofstadter! (Runs back) Fine."]}
