{"series": "4", "episode": "22", "transcript": ["Scene: A public washroom. Amy and Penny are in cubicles, Bernadette is washing her hands.", "Amy: I must say, Penny, this is great fun.", "Penny: Glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself.", "Amy: Until I met you and Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom had been entirely focused on elimination. Now they have a delightful social aspect.", "Bernadette: Amy, you must\u2019ve been in the bathroom with other women before.", "Amy: Of course I have. But they were strangers and seemed off-put when I engaged in friendly stall-to-stall chit-chat.", "Bernadette: Some women don\u2019t like to get chummy when their panties are down.", "Amy: You okay in there, bestie?", "Penny: I\u2019m fine.", "Amy: The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness, the inability to pass urine", "Penny: Yeah, I said I\u2019m fine. Stop talking to me.", "Amy: She always this crabby when she urinates?", "Bernadette: We\u2019re really not that close.", "Penny: Screw it. I\u2019ll go later.", "Amy: And I\u2019ll be right by your side.", "Scene: A shoe shop. ", "Bernadette: Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?", "Penny: Oh, that\u2019s nice.", "Amy: No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a strategic manoeuvre. Leonard\u2019s new girlfriend is testing Bernadette\u2019s loyalty to you and the group. That bitch is crafty.", "Bernadette: You think?", "Amy: Of course. How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests? By going after its weakest member.", "Bernadette: Well, what makes me the weakest member?", "Amy: Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body. You wouldn\u2019t last a minute on the Serengeti.", "Penny: Okay, Amy, you\u2019re being silly. I am not concerned about who hangs out with who. And I certainly don\u2019t have a problem with Leonard\u2019s new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup. Ooh, these are cute. Of course if I buy them, I\u2019ll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.", "Bernadette: It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to tell her we can\u2019t make it.", "Amy: Oh, no. You have to go.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t understand. I thought I was a teeny-tiny wildebeest.", "Amy: You are, with hair that smells like strawberries. And we\u2019re going to use that to our advantage.", "Penny: Wait. What are you talking about?", "Amy: By accepting the invitation, Bernadette becomes a double agent inside the enemy camp. She could ferret out Priya\u2019s tactics, identify her weaknesses and feed her false information, such as, Leonard\u2019s no stranger to back-alley cockfights.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not a very good liar. They kind of whup that out of you in Catholic school.", "Amy: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll teach you. I did two years of Cub Scouts before they found out I was a girl.", "Penny: Okay, I don\u2019t know you people. I\u2019m just an innocent woman wondering if this shoe store will take my Texaco card.", "Amy: How do you feel about concealing a recording device in the cleavage of your ample bosom?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t want anything in my ample bosom.", "Amy: Come on, Strawberries. Take one for the team.", "Credits sequence ", "Leonard: Okay, see you later.", "Sheldon: Good news. I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.", "Leonard: That is good news. Bye.", "Sheldon: Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced centre combat-area problem? Five words, transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.", "Leonard: That, that\u2019s brilliant.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s what I do. But wait, there\u2019s more. I also invented two new chess pieces. The serpent, and the old woman.", "Leonard: Okay, now I have to ask. What do they do?", "Sheldon: When the serpent slithers to an opposing player\u2019s piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves. Ugh.", "Leonard: All right.", "Sheldon: Unless, it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress, a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent.", "Leonard: Elegant.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s because it\u2019s simple.", "Leonard: Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you.", "Sheldon: And\u2026", "Leonard: And what?", "Sheldon: And a third person. It\u2019s three-person chess. I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge. You should reflect on that.", "Leonard: Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life.", "Sheldon: Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces. If he hadn\u2019t been such a hound dog, we\u2019d all have time machines.", "Leonard: Got it. Bye.", "Sheldon: You know I\u2019m right.", "Leonard (outside apartment): I think he\u2019s getting worse.", "Amy: Oh, my metatarsal are barking.", "Leonard: You okay?", "Amy: Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m just breaking in some new shoes.", "Leonard: Very pretty.", "Amy: Thank you. Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?", "Leonard: Hadn\u2019t really thought about it.", "Amy: Look.", "Leonard: Uh, sure. Very\u2026 prominent.", "Amy: Please, Leonard, don\u2019t leer, you have a girlfriend.", "Leonard: Sorry.", "Amy: So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?", "Leonard: Yeah. How did you know?", "Amy: I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, \u2019cause, you know, that\u2019s kind of my life now. Have a good night. Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Priya: Hey, you.", "Leonard: Hi. Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?", "Raj: The lonely guy and the two happy couples? I\u2019d rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.", "Priya: Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?", "Raj: I have to feel sorry for myself. I\u2019m the only one who cares. Just like I\u2019m the only one who\u2019ll have sex with me.", "Leonard: Really? In front of your sister?", "Priya: We shared a room growing up. This is not news to me.", "Raj: Excuse me. I\u2019m going to go wander the streets alone. Invisible, unwanted and unloved, a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart. (Leaves, then returns a moment later) I forgot my windbreaker. It\u2019s chilly.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: I don\u2019t understand. Is this a way to break in new shoes?", "Penny: No. Once these puppies touch the ground they\u2019re mine, and I\u2019ll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off. Pretty, pretty, pretty.", "Amy: Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.", "Penny: The what?", "Amy: Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard. Message received. Commence operation \u201cPriya Wouldn\u2019t Wanna Be-ya.\u201d", "Penny: Hey. Seriously? Didn\u2019t you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?", "Amy: I wish. A clique requires friends. I didn\u2019t have any.", "Penny: None?", "Amy: I used to take my lunch down to the maintenance room and eat with the janitor. It was nice until his wife called me a puta and made me stop. Hang on. It\u2019s the wildebeest. Priya just made a snide comment about your acting career.", "Penny: Wh\u2026 What the hell did she say?", "Amy: She thinks it\u2019s cool you\u2019re following your dream, no matter what.", "Penny: That bitch!", "Amy: How do you want to handle it?", "Penny: Um, okay. Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I\u2019m on my way to Prague to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.", "Amy: Got it. Is it going to be in 3-D?", "Penny: What? I don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter.", "Amy: I\u2019m gonna say 3-D. That\u2019ll let her know the studio has faith in it.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: You\u2019re kidding. 3-D?", "Bernadette: That\u2019s what I hear.", "Howard: Then the studio must have real faith in it.", "Leonard: Wonder why she didn\u2019t tell me.", "Priya: Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?", "Leonard: No.", "Priya: Then why are you surprised she didn\u2019t tell you?", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s not as much surprised as, uh, uh, you know, uh. th-th-th-the other thing.", "Priya: What other thing?", "Leonard: Well, you know, if you, if, if, if you, uh, I don\u2019t, oh, what\u2019s the word I\u2019m looking for?", "Howard: I\u2019m not going to help you. This is hilarious.", "Bernadette: She\u2019s also dating an astronaut.", "Priya: Wow. That\u2019s very impressive.", "Bernadette: Yeah. But Leonard\u2019s impressive, too.", "Leonard: Thank you. Befuddled. The word I was looking for was befuddled.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing three person chess by himself. ", "Sheldon: Knight to old woman six-and-a-third. Brilliant move. Thank you. (Knock on door) Will the two of you excuse me?", "Raj: I need a hug.", "Sheldon: Sorry, I have company.", "Raj: Come on, Sheldon, open the door.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t want to hug you.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want to hug you, either. I was just feeling blue.", "Sheldon: Blue, as in depressed.", "Raj: Well, not so much depressed as lonely.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know what colour lonely is.", "Raj: What?", "Sheldon: Red is angry, yellow is frightened, green is jealous and blue is depressed. Perhaps we can assign a colour to lonely.", "Raj: Nothing rhymes with orange. It\u2019s probably lonely.", "Sheldon: All right. Come in. You look positively orange with loneliness. No, I don\u2019t see that catching on at all.", "Raj: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m working on my three-person chess game.", "Raj: Oh, cool. Can I play?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s three-person chess. Did you bring a friend?", "Raj: No.", "Sheldon: Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can\u2019t play three-person chess. Can you believe this guy? Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need.", "Raj: No, thank you. I\u2019m fine.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not optional. We\u2019re out of tea. I hope you like bouillon.", "Raj: I, uh, I guess you\u2019re probably wondering what\u2019s got me down.", "Sheldon: Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece. How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey, the king\u2019s feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?", "Raj: I\u2019m going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me. I\u2019m such a basket case, I can\u2019t even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body.", "Sheldon: The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there\u2019s a one-in-five chance he\u2019ll kill himself.", "Raj: Sheldon, listen to me. I have a big decision to make, and I\u2019m scared.", "Sheldon: Yellow. Go ahead.", "Raj: A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they\u2019re testing. He says it\u2019s the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.", "Sheldon: Fascinating. What\u2019s in it?", "Raj: I\u2019m not sure. Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.", "Sheldon: I like cows.", "Raj: That\u2019s not the point.", "Sheldon: It was its own point. Go on.", "Raj: I\u2019m a scientist. My ability to think is my bread and butter. I\u2019m afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field.", "Sheldon: Rajesh, I\u2019ve had the privilege of working alongside you for many years. My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Howard: Okay, I\u2019m still trying to work this out. How did Penny meet an astronaut?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know. The regular way people meet astronauts.", "Howard: Most of those guys live in Texas.", "Bernadette: Obviously, this one doesn\u2019t.", "Howard: Okay.", "Bernadette: Leonard lives here. Priya\u2019s from India. People meet, Howard. God!", "Howard: Fine.", "Bernadette: You\u2019ve met lots of astronauts, and I\u2019ve never grilled you about that. I\u2019d thank you to extend me the same courtesy.", "Howard: I\u2019m not grilling you, I was just curious.", "Leonard: I still can\u2019t get over the fact that she got a big movie part. Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend\u2019s up to, \u2019cause I don\u2019t.", "Bernadette: Maybe that\u2019s where she met the astronaut, all right?", "Priya: I\u2019m sorry. What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?", "Bernadette: He\u2019s a consultant.", "Leonard: I thought the movie was about 18th-century Vienna?", "Bernadette: He can\u2019t have a hobby? Excuse me, I have to pee. Or is that implausible, as well?", "Howard: It\u2019s nice to have another couple to hang with, isn\u2019t it?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny (to the shoes): All right, guys, you have to go back. I can\u2019t afford you. \u201cNo, don\u2019t send", "us away, we love you.\u201d I love you, too, but you cost more than my rent. \u201cBut, Penny, you look so good in us.\u201d Damn it, the shoes are right.", "Amy: Good golly, Penny, your whimsy is boundless. (Phone rings) What do you got for me, wildebeest?", "Bernadette (in Raj\u2019s bathroom): I think they\u2019re on to me. The story\u2019s starting to fall apart.", "Amy: Calm down. Everything\u2019s going to be okay. (To Penny) We may have to kill her. Bernadette, I\u2019m putting you on speakerphone. Where are you now?", "Bernadette: In the bathroom.", "Amy: Oh, look at this, another one of our classic bathroom gabfests. What\u2019s the problem?", "Bernadette: They\u2019re just asking me all sorts of questions I can\u2019t answer.", "Amy: Just change the subject.", "Bernadette: I suppose I could get them back to talking about Leonard going to India to meet Priya\u2019s parents.", "Penny: What?", "Bernadette: They said something about going there this summer.", "Penny: What, are they getting engaged?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know. I was too busy covering my heinie on Amy\u2019s stupid astronaut story!", "Amy: What astronaut story?", "Bernadette: You texted me Penny\u2019s dating an astronaut.", "Amy: I texted architect. That\u2019s amusing. Auto-correct must\u2019ve changed it.", "Bernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s hysterical.", "Penny: All right, look, just forget about the astronaut.", "Amy: Architect. Where would you have met an astronaut?", "Penny: Look, just find out what\u2019s up with this trip to India.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t want to do this anymore!", "Penny: Don\u2019t you quit on us!", "Howard (knocking on bathroom door): Bernie, you okay?", "Bernadette (screaming): It was an architect!", "Scene: A coffee shop.", "Raj: Thank you for coming with me, Sheldon. You\u2019re a good friend.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m glad you think so. That\u2019s what I strive to emulate.", "Raj: Okay, let\u2019s see if this drug works.", "Woman at table: Can I help you?", "Raj: Forgive me for staring, but you\u2019re very beautiful.", "Woman: Thank you. That\u2019s a great accent. Where are you from?", "Raj: India.", "Woman: Oh, cool. I\u2019ve always wanted to go there.", "Raj: It\u2019s a beautiful country. You\u2019d love it. May I join you?", "Woman: Uh, okay, sure. Why not?", "Raj: My name is Dr. Rajesh Koothrappali, and this is my friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper.", "Woman: Hi.", "Sheldon: Oh, there\u2019s no need to interact with me. I\u2019m just here to observe.", "Woman: What\u2019s he observing?", "Raj: We\u2019re scientists. We observe everything. Here, go buy yourself a scone.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Raj: And what is your name?", "Woman: Angela.", "Raj: Oh, derived from the word angel. Appropriate.", "Angela: You\u2019re cute.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d like to buy a scone.", "Server: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re out. We have muffins.", "Sheldon: They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.", "Angela: What are you doing?", "Raj (taking his shirt off): Oh, just getting comfortable. So how long have you lived in Los Angeles?", "Angela: I\u2026", "Sheldon: They were out of scones.", "Raj (removing his trousers): Sheldon, I\u2019m talking to someone. You\u2019re being rude. I\u2019ll bet you\u2019re an actress. If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.", "Angela: Oh, my God.", "Raj: Wait, where are you going? We were doing so well. She never even got to see my penis. Ta-da!", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. They are playing Jenga, ", "Priya: Who wants some more coffee?", "Leonard: Thanks, yeah.", "Howard: Sure.", "Bernadette: Let me help you.", "Howard: Nice to see that the gals are getting along.", "Leonard: Gals? Who are you, Fred Flintstone?", "Bernadette: This trip to India sounds fun.", "Priya: Yeah, I think it will be.", "Bernadette: Are you concerned your parents might not approve of Leonard?", "Priya: A little. They\u2019re very old-fashioned.", "Bernadette: Well, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not like you guys are getting engaged, right?", "Priya: Oh, God, no. We\u2019re not there yet.", "Bernadette: Not engaged. Very interesting. I have to tinkle.", "Priya: You\u2019ve been in there a lot tonight. Are you okay?", "Bernadette: Yes. Are you writing a book?", "Priya: Why are you getting upset?", "Bernadette: I\u2019m not upset. Maybe you\u2019re upset.", "Priya: What\u2019s up with you? Bernadette?", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t do this anymore! I\u2019m a good girl! I went to Catholic school! (Storms out,)", "Howard: Okay, well, it\u2019s getting late. This was terrific. You win. Bernie?", "Leonard: I think the word you\u2019re looking for is befuddled.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon, Leonard and Howard are playing three person chess. ", "Sheldon: My catapult flings my bishop to Howard\u2019s Queen\u2019s Gorilla two.", "Howard: Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad. And he comes out at Leonard\u2019s Queen\u2019s Bishop", "five-and-a-third. Check on Leonard.", "Leonard: Hang on. When is my pawn allowed to use the golf cart?", "Sheldon: When it\u2019s done charging. Or you land on the time machine. Obviously.", "Leonard: Oh, oh, Beekeeper to King 12. I capture your Pope and release the swarm. Checkmate on Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I knew I should have given my Pope the jet pack.", "Raj (still naked): Hey, I\u2019ve got winners.", "\n"]}
