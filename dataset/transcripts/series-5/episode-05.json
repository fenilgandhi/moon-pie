{"series": "5", "episode": "05", "transcript": ["Scene: The comic book store.", "Leonard: It\u2019s from Game of Thrones. What do you think?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know. If we\u2019re going to start a fantasy sword collection, and I\u2019ve long thought we should, is this really the sword to start with?", "Leonard: What did you have in mind?", "Sheldon: Well, off the top of my head, I\u2019d have to go with Excalibur. It gives you the right to rule England.", "Leonard: It would be a replica of a movie prop.", "Sheldon: Fair enough. It\u2019d give you the right to rule a replica of England.", "Leonard: Well, they don\u2019t have an Excalibur here, so what do you want to do?", "Sheldon: Mm. Tough decision. There\u2019s no weaponry from Lord of the Rings, forged in a Chinese sweatshop?", "Leonard: Just Bilbo Baggins\u2019 sword over there.", "Sheldon: Two grown men with a hobbit\u2019s dagger; wouldn\u2019t we look silly? Okay, let\u2019s go for it.", "Stuart: Oh, I see you guys have found my little treasure.", "Leonard: Yeah. It\u2019s okay, I guess.", "Sheldon: Okay? It\u2019s magnificent.", "Leonard: Buh-buh-buh-buh! What do you want for it?", "Stuart: Oh, it\u2019s hard to put a price on something that\u2019s a copy of something that was on pay cable. But for my friends, let\u2019s say 250?", "Leonard: Oh, that\u2019s pretty steep.", "Stuart: Well, it\u2019s a limited edition. They only made 8,000 of these bad boys.", "Sheldon: Only 8,000? We\u2019re wasting precious time. Buy it.", "Leonard: Hang on. Can you do any better?", "Stuart: Are you kidding? I\u2019m already giving you the friends and family discount.", "Sheldon: Oh, did you hear that? We\u2019re getting the friends and family discount. We are honoured and we will take it.", "Leonard: Slow down. Two hundred.", "Sheldon: What are you doing? Two fifty is already the discounted price.", "Leonard: Will you shut up?", "Stuart: Tell you what, I\u2019ll go two thirty-five.", "Leonard: Nope. Maybe another time.", "Stuart: Okay, two twenty five, my final offer.", "Sheldon: Take it, take it.", "Leonard: Two hundred.", "Stuart: Man, you\u2019re killing me!", "Sheldon: Killing you? I can\u2019t breathe.", "Stuart: Two ten, and I\u2019m losing money.", "Sheldon: Oh, now, we can\u2019t let him lose money, Leonard. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Leonard: Two ten and you throw in the Iron Man helmet.", "Stuart: Are you crazy? That helmet\u2019s signed by Robert Downey Jr.", "Leonard: So?", "Stuart: Okay, if you\u2019re going to question the importance of an actor\u2019s signature on a plastic helmet from a movie based on a comic book, then all of our lives have no meaning!", "Leonard: Okay, fine. Just the sword, two ten.", "Stuart: Thank you. I can eat meat this week.", "Leonard: See that? I just saved us forty bucks.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve long said, what you lack in academic knowledge you make up for in street smarts.", "Stuart: You want me to wrap it?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m gonna stab my friend in the chest.", "Wil Wheaton (entering): Hey, Stuart.", "Stuart: Ah, hey, Wil.", "Sheldon: Hello, Wil Wheaton.", "Wil: Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s part of my sword collection. Do you have a sword collection?", "Wil: No.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not surprised.", "Stuart: Here\u2019s the Batman 612 with the Jim Lee alternate cover that you wanted.", "Wil: Awesome. What do I owe you?", "Stuart: Forty bucks.", "Wil: Good deal.", "Sheldon: Sucker. Didn\u2019t even ask for the friends and family discount.", "Wil: Hey, I\u2019m having a party at my house on Friday, and I was hoping you would stop by.", "Stuart: Will there be girls there?", "Wil: Yeah, of course.", "Stuart: \u2018Cause there wasn\u2019t last time.", "Wil: There will be girls. You guys are invited if you want to come by.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Wil: All right, great. Later.", "Sheldon: I see what you\u2019re doing. You accept an invitation to a party at the home of my sworn enemy, he tells everyone we\u2019re going to be there, and when we don\u2019t show, he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.", "Leonard: I was actually thinking about going.", "Sheldon: And then declaring the party a fiasco and storming out, leaving him humiliated in front of his guests. Love it.", "Leonard: No, I was gonna grab Raj and Howard and have a good time.", "Stuart: Oh, great, more guys. It\u2019s gonna be another Wil Wheaton sausage-fest.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Sheldon, can you grab me a water?", "Sheldon: Possibly.", "Leonard: Can you or can\u2019t you?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not that simple, Leonard.", "Leonard: It never is, is it?", "Sheldon: At this moment, our relationship exists in two mutually contradictory states. Until you either do not go or go to Wil Wheaton\u2019s party, you are simultaneously my friend and not my friend. I\u2019m characterizing this phenomenon as Schrodinger\u2019s Friendship.", "Leonard: Got it. Can I have my water?", "Sheldon: Of course. Now get it yourself, you traitor.", "Penny: Wait, what is going on?", "Sheldon: In case you have forgotten, Schrodinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment\u2026", "Penny: No, no, no, no, I didn\u2019t forget. Um, there\u2019s this cat in a box and until you open it, it\u2019s either dead or alive or both. Although, back in Nebraska, our cat got stuck in my brother\u2019s camp trunk, and we did not need to open it to know there was all kinds of dead cat in there.", "Amy: Homespun stories, knowledge of physics and a bosom that defies it. You\u2019re the whole package, aren\u2019t you?", "Howard (arriving): Sorry I\u2019m late. Uh, I got great news. NASA picked my team\u2019s design for the deep field space telescope that\u2019s going on the International Space Station this spring.", "All: Wow.", "Bernadette: Howie, that\u2019s wonderful! Congratulations!", "Howard: It gets better. Someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist, and guess who that someone is.", "Sheldon: Mohammed Lee.", "Howard: Who\u2019s Mohammed Lee?", "Sheldon: Mohammed is the most common first name in the world, Lee, the most common surname. As I didn\u2019t know the answer, I thought that gave me a mathematical edge.", "Howard: It\u2019s me, Sheldon. It\u2019s me. I\u2019m going up in space! Technically, I\u2019m an astronaut.", "All: Wow, that\u2019s amazing!", "Bernadette: Hang on a second. NASA doesn\u2019t have a shuttle any more. How are you going to get up there?", "Howard: Oh, well, it\u2019s really cool. You fly to Moscow, they take you out to Kazakhstan, and then you get into a Russian Soyuz rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit. Or just sits there on the launch pad because the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market.", "Bernadette: Are those Russian rockets safe?", "Howard: Well, I mean, safe as it can be when it was built by the good folks who brought you Chernobyl.", "Leonard: I\u2019d like to propose a toast. The dream to go up into space is one we all share, and Howard\u2019s making that a reality. We\u2019re all very proud of you.", "All: Cheers.", "Sheldon: That was a lovely toast. Kudos.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Simultaneously, a festival of cloying clich\u00e9s. You sicken me.", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s car.", "Howard: You\u2019re really quiet. Is everything okay?", "Bernadette: Fine. Just a little tired.", "Howard: I hope not too tired, because I\u2019m feeling particularly masculine right now. All systems go, if you catch my drift.", "Bernadette: I always catch your drift.", "Howard: All right, well, something\u2019s obviously bugging you. What is it?", "Bernadette: I just can\u2019t believe you signed up for the space program without even talking to me.", "Howard: Oh, I get it. You\u2019re worried about me. That is so sweet. You know, there\u2019s a saying we have at NASA. What makes the right stuff so right is that it always comes home.", "Bernadette: Just stop talking, Howard.", "Howard: This isn\u2019t the reaction I expected when I told you I was gonna be an astronaut.", "Bernadette: What did you think was going to happen?", "Howard: Honestly? Sex.", "Bernadette: Howard.", "Howard: Do you realize what a big deal this is? What an honour it is to be chosen to go into space?", "Bernadette: Yeah, I get it. I just wish you included me in the decision. We\u2019re supposed to be partners. We\u2019re supposed to be a team.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry. You\u2019re right. Okay, let\u2019s try this again. Bernadette, an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us, and I\u2019d like to discuss it.", "Bernadette: Okay.", "Howard: I\u2019ve been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for three weeks. What are your thoughts on that?", "Bernadette: Well, first of all, thank you for including me in the decision-making process.", "Howard: Hey, we\u2019re a team. So, what do you think?", "Bernadette: No.", "Howard: No?", "Bernadette: No.", "Howard: Well why not?", "Bernadette: Howard, my father was a police officer. We never knew from one night to the next if he was going to come home alive. It was horrible. And I don\u2019t want to live that way with you.", "Howard: Hey, my father abandoned me and my mother when I was 11. We never saw him again.", "Bernadette: Oh, boo-hoo, you\u2019re not going to space!", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Pretty cool about Howard, huh?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t talk to me as if nothing\u2019s happened between us. And yes, it sure is, buddy.", "Leonard: For God\u2019s sake, will you stop with the Schrodinger stuff.", "Sheldon: Would you prefer a simpler application of Heisenberg\u2019s uncertainty principle, in which I could either know where you are or whether I like you, but not both?", "Leonard: You never stop talking, do you?", "Amy: I don\u2019t understand. What differences does it make if Leonard goes to Wil Wheaton\u2019s party?", "Penny: Wil Wheaton is Sheldon\u2019s mortal enemy.", "Amy: Mortal enemy?", "Penny: Mm-hmm.", "Amy: Sheldon, I know you\u2019re a bit of a left-handed monkey wrench, but, you really have a mortal enemy?", "Sheldon: In fact, I have 61 of them. Would you like to see the list?", "Penny: Oh, say no, say no, say no, say no.", "Sheldon: You just got off the list. Would you like back on it? This\u2019ll just take a moment. It\u2019s on a five and a quarter inch floppy.", "Amy: A floppy disk?", "Sheldon: Well, I started the list when I was nine.", "Amy: How did Wil Wheaton get on the list?", "All: Oh! Oh, God!", "Sheldon: As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher, Wil Wheaton\u2019s character on Star Trek. So, I drove for hours by bus to a Star Trek convention at which Wil Wheaton was scheduled to appear, so that I could get my Wesley Crusher action figure signed. But he never showed, because apparently, it was cooler for him to be the lower-left corner on Hollywood Squares. Oh, damn! The floppy failed. Well, whoever was in charge of quality control at the Verbatim Corporation in 1989, congratulations, you just made the list.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Bernadette: Howard?", "Howard: Change your mind about sex? I\u2019m still mad, but I\u2019ll do it.", "Bernadette: No, I\u2019ve just been thinking. It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m afraid for your safety. I don\u2019t want to be the person who stands between you and your dreams.", "Howard: Really?", "Bernadette: Really. If going into space means that much to you, I will never say another word about it.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Bernadette: I love you.", "Howard: I love you, too. So, sex now?", "Bernadette: Okay. I just forgot to brush my teeth. I\u2019ll be right back. (Exits)", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Over my dead body my son goes into outer space!", "Bernadette: I\u2019m ready.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Leonard: Wait, let me see if I got this right. You actually asked Bernadette to leave your house in the middle of the night?", "Howard: What choice did I have? She went behind my back and turned my own mother against me.", "Raj: Wow. You\u2019re not only our first astronaut. You\u2019re also the first one of us to kick a girl out of bed. You\u2019re like a rock star.", "Howard: Little bit.", "Leonard: I hate to say it, but she did kind of betray you.", "Sheldon: Interesting. You see betrayal in others, but not yourself.", "Leonard: Going to Wheaton\u2019s party is not betraying you.", "Sheldon: Oh, of course you would have to believe that. Evil always thinks it\u2019s doing right. Excuse me, Stormtrooper. These are the droids you\u2019re looking for.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going to a party. I\u2019m not turning R2-D2 and C-3PO over to the empire!", "Sheldon: Not yet.", "Raj: So, what\u2019s gonna happen next? Are you and Bernadette going to break up?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. If we\u2019re going to get back together, she\u2019s going to have to apologize and accept that I\u2019m a grown man who can make his own decisions.", "Raj: Then she\u2019s going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space.", "Howard: Obviously.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: I had no choice. I had to tell his mother. He can\u2019t go to space. He\u2019s like a baby bird. Do you know he once got an asthma attack from reading an old library book?", "Amy: You\u2019re kidding.", "Penny: No, I was there that day. Sheldon threw his back out handing him that book.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do. I don\u2019t want to break up over this.", "Penny: Okay, why don\u2019t you just tell him you made a mistake?", "Bernadette: Do you guys think it was a mistake? Am I the bad guy in this?", "Amy: It\u2019s not for us to judge. We\u2019re just here to provide comfort and support while you come to grips with what a despicable thing you\u2019ve done.", "Bernadette: Oh, God, you\u2019re right. I took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother. I need to apologize.", "Penny: Well, that, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad you came to that. But before you do, let me just ask you a big picture question.", "Bernadette: What?", "Penny: Are you a hundred percent positive you love and want to marry Howard Wolowitz?", "Bernadette: I do, with all my heart.", "Penny: Got it. Just had to check.", "Amy: He\u2019s great.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: All right, Sheldon, we\u2019re going to Wil\u2019s. This is your last chance.", "Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is your last chance. One day, a historian is going to come to you and say, is it true you were friends with Dr. Sheldon Cooper? And you\u2019re going to have to choke back a hot sob of regret and humiliation as you mumble, I was, but I chose to go to a party thrown by the one kid from Stand By Me that no one remembers.", "Leonard: You want to drive?", "Raj: Sure.", "Leonard: Hey, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Oh, good. You picked me, you picked me.", "Leonard: No, I just got a text from Stuart. Brent Spiner is at the party.", "Sheldon: Brent Spiner?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t care.", "Leonard: Really? Brent Spiner, Mr. Data himself. You love him.", "Sheldon: I did, but I think I\u2019ve kind of outgrown Star Trek. You know, stock characters, ludicrous plots, beam me up. What a load of hooey.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going. Live long and prosper, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Yeah, even that. You look like a dork.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard, Bernadette\u2019s here!", "Howard: Tell her I\u2019m not home!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of a schmuck play is that? She can hear you shouting!", "Bernadette: Can we talk?", "Howard: You can. I have nothing to say.", "Bernadette: All right. I just wanted to tell you I\u2019m sorry I said something to your mother.", "Howard: I was gonna tell her eventually, but you went behind my back.", "Bernadette: I know. I\u2019m sorry. I got scared.", "Howard: If you\u2019re gonna love me, you\u2019re gonna have to love the whole package, the tenderhearted poet and the crazy daredevil.", "Bernadette: I know.", "Howard: Well, don\u2019t say it if you\u2019re not gonna mean it, \u2019cause I\u2019m not just gonna stop with the space station. Yeah, I want to go to the Moon, I want to go to Mars. I want to take a one-man sub to the lowest depths of the ocean.", "Bernadette: Really? You got seasick on Pirates of the Caribbean.", "Howard: Well, those big kids were rocking it.", "Bernadette: I just did what I did because I love you so much, and the thought of losing you is more than I can handle.", "Howard: Really?", "Bernadette: You\u2019re my soul mate. This is where you kiss me.", "Howard: Right, right.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Make up all you want! Your tuchus is not leaving this planet!", "Scene: Wil Wheaton\u2019s party.", "Raj: Hey, you know that beautiful actress who plays the Borg Queen in First Contact?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Raj: Well, I just met her gynaecologist!", "Leonard: What are you doing here?", "Sheldon: Fighting for our friendship. As peculiar and annoying as you can be, you\u2019re still my little buddy. I\u2019m not going to let that end here tonight. Now put down that drink, let\u2019s meet Brent Spiner and go home.", "Wil: Hey, Sheldon, I\u2019m so glad you made it. I found something I think you might like.", "Sheldon: What I\u2019d like is for him to have a more depressing home. This is quite lovely.", "Wil: This is for you.", "Sheldon: An original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure.", "Wil: I remembered your story about the time you went to a convention when you were a kid to get one signed, and I didn\u2019t show up.", "Wil: Look at what I wrote.", "Sheldon: To Sheldon, sorry this took so long. Your friend, Wil Wheaton.", "Wil: It\u2019s my last one. I want you to have it.", "Sheldon: Look, everyone. Wil Wheaton is my friend!", "Brent Spiner: Oh, wow. I haven\u2019t seen one of these in years. (Rips open action figure packaging) Remember how we used to make these things look like they were masturbating?", "Sheldon: Brent Spiner, what have you done? That was an original mint-in-package Wesley Crusher action figure signed by my close personal friend, Wil Wheaton.", "Brent: Sorry, Slim. I\u2019ve got some Mr. Data dolls in the trunk of my car. You want me to sign one for you?", "Sheldon: You\u2019ve already signed something, Brent Spiner. Your name on my list. From this moment on, you are my mortal enemy.", "Wil: Don\u2019t worry. It doesn\u2019t take up a whole lot of your time.", "Sheldon: Come on, buddy. Let\u2019s not waste another second on this loser. Love your house.", "Leonard: Can we get autographed dolls?", "Brent: Sure. Twenty bucks.", "Leonard: Ten.", "Brent: Eighteen.", "Leonard: Twelve.", "Brent: Sixteen.", "Leonard: Two for thirty. And you come to my birthday party.", "Brent: Done."]}
