{"series": "5", "episode": "03", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Who wants the last dumpling?", "Penny: Ooh, me.", "Sheldon: Penny, a moment. We just had Thai food. In that culture, the last morsel is called the krengjai piece, and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group.", "Penny: Thank you all for this high honour.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve seen pictures of your mother, keep eating.", "Howard: All right, honey, if we\u2019re gonna make the movie, we should go. (Raj stands) This may be hard for you to hear, but when I say honey, I mean my fianc\u00e9e. (Raj whispers to him) Yeah, well, now it means her.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s okay if he wants to come.", "Howard: Fine. But next time, we get a sitter.", "Penny: All right, I got to go to work. I\u2019ll walk down with you.", "Sheldon: Wait. Uh, which is closer to the new train store in Monrovia, the movie theatre or the Cheesecake Factory?", "Howard: Neither of them are close.", "Sheldon: Oh, well, then I guess it doesn\u2019t matter which one of you drives me. Let\u2019s play a fun guessing game to see who gets to take me. All right, this four-letter word describes either a printer\u2019s type size or a compulsion to eat dirt.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m not driving him.", "Sheldon: No, Penny, don\u2019t give up, you can get this.", "Leonard: Aren\u2019t you going with Sheldon?", "Amy: No, I have no interest in model trains, stores that sell them, nor their heartbreaking clientele.", "Leonard: Oh. Well, I have some work to do, so\u2026", "Amy: I can\u2019t imagine that would disturb me. Carry on.", "Leonard: Okay. Wouldn\u2019t you be more comfortable at home?", "Amy: Not really, no.", "Leonard: All righty then. Guess I\u2019ll just get started.", "Amy: Leonard, please. I don\u2019t need the running commentary.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment. Amy is staring into space.", "Leonard: Amy?", "Amy: Yo.", "Leonard: You okay?", "Amy: Oh, sure.", "Leonard: I thought you were reading.", "Amy: I was. Now I\u2019m thinking about what I read. You all right, Leonard? You seem very uncomfortable.", "Leonard: I, I\u2019m fine.", "Amy: Should I go? I\u2019ve been told sometimes I overstay my welcome.", "Leonard: What, who told you that?", "Amy: Well, most recently my gynaecologist.", "Leonard: Well, you stay as long as you\u2019d like.", "Amy: I\u2019m glad to hear you say that, because I\u2019m having a wonderful time. Hmm, I said the same thing to my gynaecologist.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s car.", "Bernadette: What are you going to get at the train store, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019m not buying anything. They\u2019re having a lecture. H-O gauge railroading. Half the size of O-gauge, but twice the fun. Very controversial topic.", "Howard: Which side do you come down on?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll let you know after tonight. Unlike some people, I\u2019m going in with an open mind. Who am I kidding? Of course we all know it\u2019s O-gauge or no gauge.", "Howard: Can you believe grown men sit around and play with toy trains?", "Bernadette: That\u2019s pretty big talk for a man with a closet full of magic tricks at his mother\u2019s house.", "Howard: First of all, they\u2019re not tricks, they\u2019re illusions. And, secondly, when we get married, they\u2019re all going up in the attic so you can have that closet for clothes.", "Bernadette: Why would I keep clothes at your mother\u2019s house?", "Howard: Well, don\u2019t think of it that way. Once we move in, it\u2019ll be our house.", "Bernadette: Is she moving out?", "Howard: Why would she move out? It\u2019s her house.", "Bernadette: Hang on. You seriously think I\u2019m going to live with your mother?", "Sheldon: Howard, I think I can help here. Yes, Bernadette, that\u2019s exactly what he thinks.", "Howard: Why not? It\u2019s a great house, plenty of room, and if we have kids, Mom\u2019s there to help. You know, when she tells the Three Little Pigs story, she actually has hair on her chinny-chin-chin.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m not gonna live with your mother. Not now, not ever.", "Howard: Wow, someone obviously has some mommy issues.", "Bernadette: Raj, take me home.", "Howard: Don\u2019t listen to her. Go to the movie theatre.", "Bernadette: Take me home now.", "Howard: Movie theatre.", "Raj: Mmmmmm.", "Sheldon: Okay, everybody calm down. There is a simple solution here. Raj, take me to the train store, and then I don\u2019t care what you people do.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: How was your shower?", "Leonard: It was good, good. Just out of curiosity, what time do you usually go to bed?", "Amy: Oh, I\u2019m up all night. I\u2019m like a possum. Boy, you were not liked in high school, were you?", "Leonard: Not really. Is that my yearbook?", "Amy: Mm-hmm. Dear Leonard, you\u2019re really good at science. Maybe one day you\u2019ll come up with a cure for being a dork.", "Leonard: Well, it wasn\u2019t spray-painting a lightning bolt on my briefcase, I can tell you that.", "Amy: If it makes you feel any better, the only person who signed my yearbook was my mother.", "Leonard: Aw.", "Amy: Dear Amy, self-respect and a hymen are better than friends and fun. Love, Mom.", "Sheldon (entering): Well, you can add Jerry\u2019s Junction to the list of train stores Sheldon Cooper will never set foot in again.", "Leonard: Rough night, Casey Jones?", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t know the half of it. It was billed as a lively give-and-take on the merits of model train sizes. But it was actually a set-up to intimidate weak-minded spineless rubes into buying H-O starter sets.", "Leonard: What\u2019s in the bag?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. But it\u2019s not a spine,I\u2019ll tell you that.", "Amy: Well, I had a delightful evening, Leonard. We should do this again sometime.", "Leonard: Ah, sure. That\u2019d be nice.", "Amy: Glad to hear it. I need someone to accompany me to the wedding of Dr. Moranelli and Dr. Gustufson this Friday. They\u2019re kind of the Brad and Angelina of the primatology department.", "Leonard: Wouldn\u2019t you rather bring Sheldon?", "Amy: I would, but the last wedding we went to was a disaster. He behaved like a child the entire time.", "Sheldon: Not my fault. You said there\u2019d be other scientists there my age.", "Amy: Doesn\u2019t matter. You\u2019re out, he\u2019s in. No date to the prom, two dates to a wedding. Hmm, how times change.", "Sheldon: Ha-ha, you have to go to a wedding.", "Scene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. Amy rings the bell.", "Howard (off): I\u2019ll get it!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Could you get it?", "Howard (off): I said I\u2019m getting it!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Fine, I\u2019ll get it!", "Howard: I got it! Oh, hi.", "Bernadette: Hey. I don\u2019t want to fight. I was just surprised when you sprung the whole living-with-your-mom stuff on me.", "Howard: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t run it by you first.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to, but in or out! We don\u2019t need bugs!", "Howard: The bugs only come here because you\u2019re their queen! Listen, how about this. Before we make any kind of decision about where we live, we have a trial run. Stay here for a weekend, see what it\u2019s like.", "Bernadette: And your mom would be okay with that?", "Howard: Sure she would. Ma, do you mind if Bernadette stays here this weekend?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Hey, if she\u2019s willing to give the milk away for free, who am I to say no?", "Howard: See? She\u2019s good with it.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Frankly, after all your sleepovers with the little brown boy, a girl is a big relief!", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is playing with his train set.", "Sheldon: All this years, I\u2019ve been so wrong. The tinier the train, the more concentrated the fun.", "Penny: You\u2019re a brain scientist. Can you explain to me why a brilliant man likes playing with toy trains?", "Amy: Not without cutting his head open, no. How about making my eyes like Cleopatra?", "Penny: Really? For a wedding?", "Amy: Perhaps you\u2019re right. My cheekbones and beckoning pelvis already have a certain hello sailor quality to them.", "Leonard: Ready.", "Penny: Aw. So handsome. Like James Bond.", "Sheldon: Better than James Bond, because he\u2019s tinier.", "Amy: I got you this to give to me.", "Penny: Oh, sweetie, guests don\u2019t normally wear corsages to a wedding. That\u2019s more of a prom thing.", "Amy: I never went to my prom. My mom paid my cousin to take me, but he just used the money to buy drugs.", "Penny: Put the corsage on her.", "Leonard: Amy, this is for you.", "Amy: When you\u2019re done copping a feel, that goes on my wrist.", "Sheldon: All aboard! Woo-woo! It\u2019s official. I\u2019m an H-O trainiac.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: So, dinner went nice.", "Bernadette: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. Does your mother always cut your meat for you?", "Howard: Only when it\u2019s fatty. Well, don\u2019t be jealous, babe. Someday you\u2019ll get to cut it for me.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Bernadette! I found the extra head for the Waterpik if you want to use it!", "Bernadette: I\u2019m okay, Mrs. Wolowitz.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): You sure? I just squirted half a brisket outta my teeth!", "Howard: Hey, Ma, how about a little privacy?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Oh, I know what that means! Hubba-hubba!", "Bernadette: Oh, God.", "Howard: Relax, it\u2019ll be fine.", "Bernadette: Okay.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Let me know when you\u2019re done canoodling! Mommy needs a foot rub!", "Scene: The wedding.", "Amy: Would you like to dance?", "Leonard: No, thank you. I\u2019m really not much of a dancer.", "Amy: You\u2019re not exactly winning any trophies as a conversationalist, either.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry. The bride and groom seem happy.", "Amy: Why shouldn\u2019t they be? They have a feverish night of socially-approved copulation ahead of them. In some cultures, we\u2019d stand outside of their bedroom cheering as they achieved orgasm.", "Leonard: That sounds like a late night, and I have work in the morning, so\u2026", "Amy: Leonard, you may not have noticed, but I am being a delight here. And you\u2019re not holding up your end of the evening.", "Leonard: Oh, sorry. This wedding just reminds me of my kinda-sorta girlfriend 9,000 miles away.", "Amy: I have a kinda-sorta boyfriend who\u2019s playing with a model train right now, you don\u2019t hear me bitching about it. Leonard, a word of advice, moody self-obsession is only attractive in men who can play guitar and are considerably taller than you.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not moody. I\u2019m fun.", "Amy: You have any evidence to support that statement?", "Leonard: Well, hey, I\u2019m just as much fun as you are.", "Amy: Really? Are you willing to draw a moustache on your finger as a conversational icebreaker? I am.", "Leonard: Okay, fine, what do you suggest?", "Amy: We just had a lovely meal, the band is on fire, and you\u2019re sitting next to a beautiful woman wearing whorish makeup. Why don\u2019t we head outon the dance floor and see if I can sweat through these dress shields.", "Leonard: Once again, I, I\u2019m really not much of a dancer.", "Amy: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll lead. (They do the Birdie Song dance)", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom. Howard is playing with a lightsabre.", "Amy: Howard?", "Howard: Ready for bed?", "Bernadette: No. I need to brush my teeth, but your mother\u2019s been in the bathroom for, like, an hour.", "Howard: Oh. Yeah, she sometimes has problems doing her business. Hang on. Ma, give up! Tonight\u2019s not your night!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): You don\u2019t know that! I just sat down!", "Howard: Come on, take a break! Bernadette needs to brush her teeth!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): She can come in and brush her teeth! I\u2019m not embarrassed!", "Howard: Problem solved.", "Bernadette: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019m not going in there.", "Howard: Oh, come on, honey. She\u2019s just sitting in there reading a magazine. You can\u2019t see anything. I go in all the time.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Ha! The eagle has landed!", "Howard: And we have splashdown. Wait here, I\u2019m gonna go light a candle. And then we make passionate love.", "Scene: The stairwell. Amy is helping Leonard up the stairs.", "Amy: There we go, last floor.", "Leonard: I just can\u2019t figure out what happened. I put my left leg in, I took my left leg out, I put my left leg in, and something just snapped.", "Amy: The hokey pokey is a young man\u2019s game.", "Leonard: I did have a great time. Thank you for reminding me it\u2019s okay to have fun once in a while.", "Amy: You\u2019re welcome.", "Leonard: And also for breaking the head off the ice swan so I could hold it against my pulled groin.", "Amy: I excel at spatial reasoning, and I had a hunch that the graceful slope of its neck would cradle your genitals nicely.", "Leonard: Well, okay. Again, thank you.", "Amy: And again, you\u2019re welcome.", "Leonard: Want to come in, have a cup of tea?", "Amy: No, thanks. I\u2019m gonna head home.", "Leonard: Okay. Well, good night.", "Amy: Good night. (Heads across corridor and knocks on Penny\u2019s door)", "Penny: Ames, hi. How was the wedding?", "Amy: Great. Until I accidentally made Leonard fall in love with me.", "Penny: Come in, let\u2019s talk. Do you want a glass of wine?", "Amy: Wine is one of the reasons I\u2019m in this fix. That and this dang pelvis.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, what exactly happened?", "Amy: The inevitable, he was lonely and vulnerable from missing his girlfriend, while I was charming, supportive and, let\u2019s face it, in this dress, the perfect combination of Madonna and whore.", "Penny: Oh, God, did he make a move on you?", "Amy: No, but it\u2019s only a matter of time. How could I have not seen this coming? Now I\u2019m gonna have to break the little sad sack\u2019s heart.", "Penny: Yeah, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be okay.", "Amy: Oh, Penny, much as I would treasure knowing that the two of us had been defiled by the same man, Leonard just doesn\u2019t get my motor running.", "Penny: So, um, what are you gonna do? Do you want me to talk to Leonard, let him down easy?", "Amy: No. I\u2019ll let him have tonight. Then in the morning, I\u2019ll send him an e-mail letting him know this body is never gonna be his wonderland. I mean, frankly, you\u2019ve got a better shot than he does.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Leonard. Check it out. I bought an N-gauge locomotive. Half the size of H-O. Look, it fits in my mouth.", "Leonard: Sounds like you had a great night.", "Sheldon: I did. How was yours?", "Leonard: Not bad. I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would.", "Sheldon: What exactly do you mean by that?", "Leonard: Well, it turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time. Although, truth be told, my groin\u2019s a little worse for wear. (Sheldon hits him) Ow! Why did you do that?", "Sheldon: To send a message. She is not for you.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: Not for you!", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Bernadette: Good morning, handsome.", "Howard: Morning, Mom.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s me.", "Howard: Yes, it is, and you\u2019re so pretty in the morning.", "Bernadette: Your mom and I made you breakfast.", "Howard: Oh, wow. So you guys are getting along?", "Bernadette: Yeah, I guess. We\u2019re very different people, Howard, so communication\u2019s a little tricky.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Does he like the pancakes?!", "Bernadette (in a similar voice): He didn\u2019t try them yet!", "Howard: Is there any butter?", "Bernadette: It\u2019s butter-flavoured syrup.", "Howard: Oh.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): So, what\u2019s the word?", "Bernadette: He wants butter!", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): It\u2019s butter-flavoured syrup", "Bernadette: I just told him that!", "Howard: I don\u2019t need any butter.", "Bernadette: If you want butter, I\u2019ll get you butter.", "Howard: Well, I guess I\u2019ll cut these by myself."]}
