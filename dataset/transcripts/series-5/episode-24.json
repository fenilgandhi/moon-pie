I also have a hysterical bit planned for later where I pretend to cry through the whole launch.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Sheldon, what channel is NASA TV?", "Sheldon: 289, right between the Game Show Network at 288 and the East coast feed of the Disney Channel on 290.", "Amy: I love his eidetic memory, it\u2019s so sexy. Sheldon, what are the ingredients in Pringles?", "Sheldon: Dried potatoes, vegetable oil, corn flower, wheat starch, maltodextrin, salt, and my favourite ingredient of all, uniformity.", "Amy: The uterus quivers, does it not?", "Leonard: There\u2019s Howard\u2019s rocket, live from Kazakhstan.", "Bernadette: Oh, God, I\u2019m so nervous. I don\u2019t think I can watch.", "Raj: You\u2019re nervous? I\u2019ve been stress-eating for four days. Look at me. I\u2019m wearing my fat pants.", "Sheldon: Remarkable. In just under a half hour, 200 metric tons of fuel will ignite in a controlled explosion right beneath Howard\u2019s keister. And all from a country whose entire contribution to the global economy, has been Tetris and mail-order brides.", "Bernadette: Give me those damn Pringles.", "Scene: Soyuz capsule.", "Cosmonaut (in Russian): Are all of the systems of the ship ready?", "Mission Control: Da.", "Mike: Okay, we\u2019re in the final countdown. How you doing over there?", "Howard: Good! Good! Oh, quick question, I missed it in the briefing. How much urine do these suits hold?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Soyuz capsule.", "Mike: Hey, Froot Loops, want to hit your fan switch?", "Howard: Check.", "Cosmonaut: He calls you Froot Loops because of your very gay haircut?", "Howard: No, it\u2019s \u2019cause I live with my mom and she makes me Froot Loops.", "Cosmonaut: Go with gay story, people are more accepting of that.", "Mike: Actually, Froot Loops just got married to a girl.", "Cosmonaut: Congratulations.", "Howard: Thanks, we decided to do it before the launch.", "Cosmonaut: You and Mrs. Loops have a big wedding?", "Howard: Not exactly. Listen, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m not really up for chatting. I\u2019m just going to sit here quietly and let my life flash before my eyes. That went really quick. Let me try it again.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: Close your eyes. Put out your hand. I got you something special.", "Bernadette: Come on, Howard. I\u2019m not falling for that again.", "Howard: No, here.", "Bernadette: Oh, Howie. A little star, it\u2019s beautiful. Put it on me.", "Howard: Okay, but I\u2019m going to have to get it back from you so I can take it to the International Space Station. That way, when I come home, you will have a star that was actually in space.", "Bernadette: Oh, my God.", "Howard: Take that, every guy who\u2019s ever bought you anything.", "Bernadette: This is the most amazing gift I\u2019ve ever gotten.", "Howard: Really? Well, if you like it that much, then close your eyes and put out your hand.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): \u2018m going to the supermarket to buy snacks for your trip. Do you want me to get those little boxes of Froot Loops you like?", "Howard: No! When I eat Froot Loops, the other astronauts make fun of me!", "Bernadette: Howard, I don\u2019t want to wait until you\u2019re back to get married.", "Howard: What?", "Bernadette: I want to be married to you before you get in that rocket.", "Howard: But I\u2019m leaving in two days.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): What about Apple Jacks?", "Howard: I don\u2019t need to take cereal.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): What kind of breakfast do you think they\u2019re going to give you in Russia?", "Howard: They invented blintzes. I\u2019ll be fine.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): They invented the lightbulb in New Jersey. It doesn\u2019t mean they hand them out to you when you go.", "Bernadette: We\u2019ll have a quick little ceremony with just our friends, and we\u2019ll still have the big reception with everyone when you get back.", "Howard: Wow. Okay. Let\u2019s get married.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): You know what, I\u2019ll buy you All-Bran in case you get stopped up in outer space.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Bernadette: So anyway, we decided to go down to City Hall this afternoon get married, and then have the reception when Howard gets back.", "Leonard: That\u2019s so great. (Others also make encouraging sounds)", "Howard: I mean, we know it\u2019s short notice, but we\u2019d love you all to come with us.", "Amy: No, no, no, this is not the wedding I wanted! I want to wear my maid of honour dress and walk down the aisle with a hundred eyes on me, while a string quartet plays The Way You Look Tonight.", "Bernadette: That wasn\u2019t going to be our processional music.", "Amy: Well, it was going to be mine.", "Sheldon: Thank you for the invitation, but I have to decline because it doesn\u2019t sound like something I\u2019ll enjoy.", "Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, it\u2019ll be fun.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s what you said about The Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.", "Bernadette: So, what do you say, Amy?", "Amy: Can I wear my maid of honour dress?", "Bernadette: Seriously? You\u2019re going to wear that thing to City Hall?", "Amy: It\u2019s all I have left. You\u2019re going to take that from me, too?", "Scene: City Hall.", "Penny: Amy, you look great.", "Amy: I know.", "Leonard: Where\u2019d you get a beer?", "Raj: From that happy young couple over there with all the tattoos. Beautiful story, they\u2019re in rival drug gangs, and they\u2019re getting married. Shh, no one can know.", "Amy: Look at all these people in love. It kind of gets you thinking, doesn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: It does, indeed. Leonard, is it awkward being here with Penny given that you recently proposed to her?", "Howard: You proposed to Penny?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.", "Raj: Where did he pop the question? What did you say?", "Leonard: She said no, can we drop it now?", "Penny: It wasn\u2019t a real proposal.", "Bernadette: Why wasn\u2019t it a real proposal?", "Sheldon: He asked her during coitus.", "Howard: Did you get down on one knee or were you already there?", "Bernadette: Howard, don\u2019t talk like that on your wedding day.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, Ma\u2026 Bernadette. Ma\u2026 Burna\u2026 You\u2019re ma Bernadette.", "Penny: Good move telling Sheldon.", "Leonard: What, I can\u2019t propose? I can\u2019t talk to my friends? Is there anything else I\u2019m not allowed to do?", "Amy: All right, that\u2019s enough. Today is not about you two. Today is about Howard and Bernadette and me.", "Registrar: Folks, can I have your attention. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock, we\u2019re going to be able to take three more couples. The rest of you will have to come back on Monday.", "Bernadette: Oh, no.", "Howard: I got this. Excuse me, but is there any way you could squeeze us in? See, I\u2019m an astronaut and I\u2019m leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.", "Registrar: Yeah, me, too. I\u2019ll see you there.", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re not going to get married.", "Amy: Excuse me, I\u2019m going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honour.", "Scene: Soyuz capsule.", "Cosmonaut: So, I tell my wife, get a dog, don\u2019t get a dog, I\u2019m not walking it, I\u2019m not feeding it, I\u2019m not picking up after it.", "Mike: You know you\u2019re going to wind up walking it.", "Cosmonaut: I know.", "Howard: Uh, shouldn\u2019t you guys be talking about space stuff instead of dogs?", "Mike: Dimitri, Froot Loops would be more comfortable if we talked about space stuff.", "Dimitri: Okay, I\u2019m going into space, and when I come back, I have to pick up a poodle crap.", "Mike: Is that better?", "Howard: Thanks.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory bar.", "Howard: You know, we could always drive to Vegas and get married.", "Bernadette: No, isn\u2019t that kind of tacky?", "Penny: Hey, I know tons of people who got married in Vegas.", "Bernadette: Are any of them still married?", "Penny: Yeah, I mean, not to the same people but\u2026", "Bernadette: There\u2019s got to be some place special we could do it.", "Sheldon: Leonard, where did you envision marrying Penny?", "Leonard: Will you shut up?", "Raj: Well, I know how to make it special.", "Howard: I told you we are not recreating the wedding from The Sound of Music.", "Raj: Yes, you made that brutally clear to me. What I was going to suggest is if that you\u2019re willing to wait until Sunday morning, the Google satellite will be over Pasadena. You can have a wedding photograph from space.", "All: Oh!", "Leonard: That\u2019s so cool.", "Howard: Oh, wait to go, Raj.", "Raj: I keep telling you, if I wasn\u2019t an astrophysicist, I would have been a party planner. It was always a coin flip.", "Howard: Okay, so we know we\u2019re going to do it Sunday morning. Now we need to find a good place for the satellite to see us.", "Leonard: How about our roof?", "Bernadette: Oh, I like that.", "Howard: That\u2019s great.", "Amy: Oh, my gosh. I can\u2019t believe my maid of honour dress is going to be on Google Earth.", "Howard: So, we have the where and the when, but we still need to figure out who\u2019s going to do the ceremony.", "Penny: Well, that\u2019s easy. Anyone can go online and get ordained as a minister. I know a piercing parlour where, for a hundred bucks they\u2019ll marry you and stick a wedding ring through any body part you want.", "Bernadette: Great, well, who\u2019s it going to be?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll do it, provided I can perform the ceremony in Klingon.", "Bernadette: No.", "Sheldon: What do you see in her?", "Scene: Soyuz capsule.", "Dimitri (in Russian): Mission Control, say again, how fast is it leaking?", "Howard: Leaking? What\u2019s leaking?", "Dimitri: Fuel. Shh.", "Mission Control (in Russian): Not bad. We feel okay to go.", "Dimitri (in Russian): Okay, thanks Mission Control.", "Howard: There\u2019s fuel leaking and we\u2019re still going to go?", "Mike: Don\u2019t lose your Froot Loops, Froot Loops.", "Dimitri: This happens a lot. Nine times out of ten, no problem.", "Howard: What happens on the tenth time?", "Dimitri: Problem.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: Hey, guys, before I forget, I got you a little groomsman present.", "Raj: Oh, thanks, man.", "Sheldon: You didn\u2019t have to do that.", "Howard: Fantastic Four, annual number three from 1965, in mint condition. The one where Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl get married.", "Leonard: Oh, wow.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear. I was afraid of this.", "Howard: What?", "Sheldon: While a thoughtful gift, this comic book in this condition is worth at least a hundred dollars.", "Howard: Yeah, so?", "Sheldon: I bought you and Bernadette a gravy boat worth eighty-eight dollars. Which places me in your debt and I can\u2019t be in your debt because someday you might ask me to help you move, or to kill a man.", "Leonard: I doubt he\u2019ll ask you to kill a man.", "Sheldon: Well, what if it\u2019s his only way out? I can\u2019t risk it. Here is twelve dollars. Now, we\u2019re even. Wait, wait, wait, I bought a card. Give me two dollars. And for the record, this is why I hate gift-giving.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s door. Howard knocks.", "Amy: Who is it?", "Howard: It\u2019s the groom.", "Amy: Can\u2019t come in. Bad luck to see the bride.", "Howard: Okay, uh, fine. Bernie, I have to go pick up my mother. I\u2019ll be right back.", "Bernadette (off): Why can\u2019t she drive herself?", "Howard: She doesn\u2019t want to sit in her dress and wrinkle it so I\u2019m going to lay her down in the back of my neighbour\u2019s van.", "Bernadette (off): All right, just hurry!", "Howard: Okay, I\u2019ll see you later, Ma\u2026 uh\u2026 lovely bride-to-be. I really got to watch that.", "Scene: The roof.", "Leonard: Come on, Raj, we\u2019re ready to start.", "Raj: What, we\u2019re ready when I say we\u2019re ready. Uh-du-du-du, ooh, okay, now we\u2019re ready.", "Howard: Ma, you want to move your chair over here so you can see?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m fine where I am. I don\u2019t want to fall off the roof.", "Howard: You\u2019ll fall through the roof before you fall off it.", "Raj: Penny. (She starts music playing) ", "Mr Rostenkowski: Your new mother-in-law\u2019s a piece of work.", "Bernadette: Not now, Dad.", "Mr Rostenkowski: She\u2019s got a bigger mustache than me. Here you go.", "Bernadette: Here you go? What am I, a football?", "Mr Rostenkowski: Like that guy could catch a football.", "Raj: Howard and Bernadette, the five of us stand before you as your friends and newly ordained ministers.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Louder!", "Bernadette: They all got ordained, they\u2019re all marrying us, it\u2019s adorable, if you want to hear come closer.", "Raj: Guys, when I look at the two of you starting your lives together, it fills my heart, It fills my, heart, okay, I\u2019m going to need a minute.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll go. Howard and Bernadette, I know you two planned on getting married in a big fancy wedding, but when you\u2019re in love, it doesn\u2019t matter where or how these things happen. It just matters that you have each other.", "Leonard: Hmm.", "Penny: Problem?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: I think the Reverend Hofstadter is making an ironic connection between your statement about love and your rejection of his proposal in the bedroom.", "Penny: Oh, grow up.", "Leonard: Hey, I didn\u2019t say it.", "Amy: All right, that\u2019s enough from the both of you.", "Penny: Well, he started it.", "Amy: Well, I\u2019m ending it. Bernadette, I want to thank you for allowing me to be your maid of honour. I also want you to know, that I will be happy to do it again if this marriage craps out.", "Leonard: Thank you, Amy. Very touching. Howard and Bernadette, you are lucky enough to be best friends who love each other. And that\u2019s the strongest kind of love because at its core, it has kindness, patience, and respect. Qualities that are hard to find in people these days.", "Sheldon: Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned. All right, my turn. Howard, Bernadette. Daq tu\u2019 taH Daq yIn tlhej ghajtaH.\n", "Bernadette: Sheldon! I told you no Klingon.", "Sheldon: Fine, I\u2019ll do it in English, but it loses something. The need to find another human being to share one\u2019s life with has always puzzled me. Maybe because I\u2019m so interesting all by myself. With that being said, may you find as much happiness with each other as I find on my own. The Klingon would have made you cry.", "Raj: I believe you two have prepared vows?", "Bernadette: Howard Joel Wolowitz, like you, this is going to be short and sweet. I love you with all my heart and soul and promise to be with you forever.", "Howard: Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Speak up!", "Howard: Hey, from now on, she\u2019s the only women who can yell at me! Until I met you, I couldn\u2019t imagine spending my life with just one person. And now I can\u2019t imagine spending one day of it without you.", "All: By the power vested in us, by the state of California\u2026", "Sheldon: And the Klingon High Council\u2026", "All: We now pronounce you husband and wife.", "Scene: Soyuz capsule.", "Mike: That\u2019s ignition. I love this part.", "Dimitri: Me, too.", "Howard: I have strongly mixed feelings.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Bernadette: Oh, my God, it\u2019s happening.", "Penny: Did I miss it?", "Leonard: No, come on in. Hurry.", "Bernadette: I love that man.", "Raj: Me, too.", "Penny: I can\u2019t believe it. This whole time, a small part of me thought he was lying.", "Leonard: This is it.", "Sheldon: Boldly go, Howard Wolowitz.", "(Russian countdown ends, rocket takes off)", "Howard (voice off): Oy vay!", "Teleplay: Chuck Lorre, Steven Molaro & Jim Reynolds", "Story: Bill Prady, Eric Kaplan & Steve Holland"]}
