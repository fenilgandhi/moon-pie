{"series": "5", "episode": "10", "transcript": ["Scene: The comic book store.", "Howard: It\u2019s amazing people keep coming to comic book stores instead of just downloading comics digitally.", "Leonard: It\u2019s probably for the best. For a lot of these guys, the weekly trip here is the only chance their mom has to go down to the basement and change their sheets.", "Howard: Oh, that reminds me, I get fresh sheets tonight. Yay.", "Sheldon: Well? What do you think of New Comic Book Night? Magic, huh?", "Amy: Sheldon, I\u2019m disappointed. As a brilliant man, you\u2019re entitled to a vice. I could understand frequenting an opium den or hunting your fellow man for sport. But this? Lame-o.", "Sheldon: Well, A, comic books employ storytelling through sequential art, a medium that dates back 17,000 years to the cave paintings of Lascaux, and B, you play the harp. Like that\u2019s cool.", "Stuart: Can I help you find anything?", "Amy: A comic that depicts a woman whose bosom can\u2019t be used as a floatation device.", "Stuart: Sorry. Most of the guys who come in here like big boobs. Couple of them have big boobs.", "Raj: Hey, look, the new Warlords of Ka\u2019a expansion pack is out.", "Howard: A new one? Unbelievable. They just keep making up more cheesy monsters, slapping them on cards and selling them at 25 bucks a pop. It\u2019s like a secret tax on guys who can\u2019t get laid.", "Raj: They\u2019re not even trying. Remember the Satanimals pack with the Hellephant? Why, absurd. What was he, a bad elephant who died and went to hell? What could an elephant possibly do that would cause him eternal damnation?", "Howard: Wild West and Witches? What kind of loser cares about a showdown between Billy the Kid and the White Wizard of the North?", "Raj: A total loser. Obviously a guy with a six-shooter beats an old man with a magic wand.", "Leonard: Well, ho-hold on. What if the wizard casts a Helmet of Confusion spell on Billy the Kid\u2019s cowboy hat?", "Howard: What? Please! This is Billy the Kid we\u2019re talking about. I mean, the wizard would get shot between the eyes before he could ever get out the words, what the hell is Billy the Kid doing in the mystic realm of Ka\u2019a?", "Stuart: Leonard, what\u2019s the deal with Sheldon\u2019s friend Amy? Are they a couple?", "Leonard: Couple of weirdos. Why?", "Howard: You interested in Amy?", "Stuart: Well, I mean, she didn\u2019t look through me with soul-sucking, ball-shriveling hatred and contempt. I like that in a woman. Could you run it by Sheldon if I could ask her out?", "Leonard: Sure. I guess.", "Raj: Stuart, settle an argument for us. Who would win, Billy the Kid or the White Wizard?", "Stuart: If I tell you that, I\u2019m robbing you of the hours of fun you could have for the magical, rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 low price of $24.95.", "Raj: I\u2019ll take one.", "Howard: Mmm, make it two.", "Leonard: I hate all of you and myself. Three.", "Stuart: I\u2019ll ring it up. Like shooting nerds in a barrel.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Hey, can I talk to you about something? It\u2019s a little awkward.", "Sheldon: I know what this is about. Given the professional standstill you\u2019re at, you\u2019re wondering if this is the appropriate time to abandon your research and focus on teaching. Yes. And if I may suggest, consider changing disciplines. Yeah, to the humanities, perhaps history. One of the advantages of teaching history is that you don\u2019t have to create things, you know, you just have to remember stuff that happened and then parrot it back. You could have fun with that.", "Leonard: Yeah, that\u2019s not it. Stuart\u2019s kind of interested in Amy.", "Sheldon: Oh, of course he is. She\u2019s very interesting. Did you know, when she was 14, she severed the webbing between her own toes?", "Leonard: No. He wanted me to find out if you\u2019d have a problem with him asking her out.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not sure how to respond, Leonard. I don\u2019t own Amy. Can\u2019t own a person. At least not since? 1863. President Lincoln freed the? Slaves! Come on Leonard, if you\u2019re going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you\u2019ll have to know.", "Leonard: You know what? Never mind. I\u2019m going to tell him it\u2019s okay to ask her out.", "Sheldon: The question is moot. There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia.", "Leonard: All right, but just for the record, I checked in with you to see how you\u2019d feel about it.", "Sheldon: Fine. The record shall so reflect. Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist.", "Leonard: I am not washed-up.", "Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can\u2019t until you admit the problem.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Well, ladies, we killed the bottle.", "Amy: I had half a glass.", "Bernadette: I didn\u2019t have any.", "Penny: Okay, don\u2019t judge me. So, what do you want to do, go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?", "Amy: Or we play Travel Twister.", "Bernadette: Amy, really? Twister?", "Amy: Excuse me. I\u2019ve passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot more exciting when you play with other people. What do you say, bestie? We can do shirts and skins. I\u2019m shirts. Called it.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m too small for Twister. And roller coasters. And sitting with my feet on the floor. Hope you enjoyed the prenatal cigarettes, Mom.", "Penny: Hey, you know, my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me, and I turned out just fine. Hey, look, I have peach schnapps. Thank God.", "Amy (reading a text on her phone): Guys, something happened.", "Penny: What\u2019s wrong?", "Amy: I think a boy likes me.", "Bernadette (reading): Hi. It\u2019s Stuart. We met at the comic book store. I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get coffee sometime. It\u2019s okay if you say no. It might be the kick in the pants I need to start taking Zoloft.", "Penny: Amy, little vixen. Just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester.", "Bernadette: What are you going to do? Doesn\u2019t he know you have a boyfriend?", "Penny: Oh, she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend, she has a Sheldon. So do you like Stuart?", "Amy: I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s nice. He\u2019s funny. He has the sallow, drawn countenance associated with an overactive thyroid gland. That\u2019s kind of hot.", "Penny: Okay, look, sweetie, we all love Sheldon, but you\u2019ve been with him over a year now. If it\u2019s not going anywhere, what does it hurt to look around?", "Bernadette: Well, yeah, I guess they\u2019re not engaged like me and Howie.", "Penny: Yeah, for what it\u2019s worth, engaged people can look around, too. Lot of options out there.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Sheldon: Where\u2019s Stuart?", "Speccy Guy Behind Counter (sniggering): Out.", "Sheldon: Who are you?", "Speccy Guy: I\u2019m Dale. He left me in charge.", "Leonard: Really?", "Dale: Yeah. I don\u2019t get it, either.", "Leonard: I want to return this Wild West and Witches Ka\u2019a expansion pack.", "Dale: Sorry. I don\u2019t do returns. They\u2019re hard.", "Leonard: Sure, sure. Uh, when will Stuart be back?", "Dale: I don\u2019t know. He went out for coffee. With a girl.", "Sheldon: Oh, I guess I was wrong.", "Leonard: You okay?", "Sheldon: Am I okay? Leonard, I\u2019m on a lifelong trajectory that includes a Nobel Prize and cities named after me, all four wisdom teeth fit comfortably in my mouth without need of extraction, and my bowel movements run like a German train schedule. Am I okay?", "Dale: I\u2019m okay, too!", "Scene: The apartment. They are playing Warlords of Ka\u2019a.", "Raj: Wild Bill Witchcock.", "Leonard: A tribe of Abra-Comanches.", "Sheldon: Flaming Spittoon. And for the record, I\u2019m very disappointed in you cowpokes. We\u2019re playing our inaugural round of Wild West and Witches, and I\u2019m the only one who bothered to dress for the occasion. (Spits into a spittoon) Patooie.", "Howard: We\u2019re not wearing cowboy hats, Sheldon. It looks ridiculous.", "Sheldon: And I suppose my boots and spurs are ridiculous, too?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: Very.", "Raj: Incredibly so.", "Sheldon: Did it look ridiculous when we got the Satanimals pack and I dressed up as a Beelzebobcat?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: Very.", "Raj: Incredibly so.", "Sheldon: All right, fine. Let\u2019s just play.", "Leonard: We should go easy on him. Amy\u2019s out with Stuart tonight.", "Howard: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Sheldon\u2019s patented blend of condescension and no sex isn\u2019t enough to hold on to a woman?", "Sheldon: Cluck, cluck, cluck. What are we, ladies at a quilting bee? Or are we men playing a fantasy card game set in a magical frontier town?", "Howard: Sorry. Creepy Tepee.", "Raj: Annie Ogly.", "Leonard: Hocus Pocus Pocahontas.", "Sheldon: And may I point out it is the three of you who are obsessed with Stuart and Amy, not me. I think you need to ask yourselves who\u2019s really being ridiculous here. (Walks away with spurs jangling)", "Leonard: It\u2019s you.", "Howard: You are.", "Raj: Totally you.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Raj: Hey, guys, check it out. The deluxe limited edition Wild West and Witches expansion pack in the signed and numbered collector\u2019s tin.", "Leonard: Oh come on, no! We just bought the regular pack.", "Howard: Ooh, a sheriff\u2019s badge.", "Raj: Yeah, it\u2019s also a wand.", "Leonard: With a hologram? Nice. Hey, do you see this?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m in the matrix, Leonard, I see everything.", "Leonard: You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. You friended Stuart on Facebook?", "Howard: I thought you didn\u2019t like Facebook anymore.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019m a fan of anything that tries to replace actual human contact.", "Raj: Please. You\u2019re looking at Facebook to find out how their date went.", "Sheldon: Really? You think I care if a man, what, shared a pumpkin latte with a dynamite lady?", "Raj: You\u2019re so full of it.", "Sheldon: You are free to believe whatever you like. And unfriend Rajesh Koothrappali.", "Raj: You unfriended me? Seriously?", "Howard: Oh, yeah. Now he\u2019s gonna miss all those great updates like, I can\u2019t believe I waited this long to make my own potpourri.", "Leonard: Sheldon, why don\u2019t you just acknowledge that you have feelings for Amy and you don\u2019t want her going out with other men?", "Sheldon: And unfriend Leonard Hofstadter.", "Howard: Here\u2019s a radical thought. Go old-school, challenge Stuart to a fight. I mean, nothing makes the ladies hotter than two skinny white guys swatting at each other with their eyes closed.", "Sheldon: And unfriend Howard Wolowitz.", "Leonard: That\u2019s all of us. Can I use the laptop?", "Sheldon: Why?", "Leonard: I have to buy that stupid collector\u2019s tin.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment door. Sheldon knocks three times.", "Penny (off): Who do we love?", "Sheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)", "Penny (off): Who do we love?", "Sheldon: Penny. (Knock, knock, knock)", "Penny (off): Who do we love?", "Sheldon: Penny.", "Penny: Hello, Sheldon. Come on in.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Penny: What\u2019s up?", "Sheldon: I came to ask if you would like to go on a date with me.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry, what?", "Sheldon: A date. You and me. Dining, dancing, perhaps you\u2019d like to take in a prizefight.", "Penny: God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?", "Sheldon: No. Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart? And whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.", "Penny: Okay, listen to me. Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.", "Sheldon: I am not trying to get her back. But, out of curiosity, what is a way?", "Penny: All right, honey, let me tell you a story. There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt. Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it. Do you see where I\u2019m going with this?", "Sheldon: I believe I do.", "Penny: Mm.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m the guy.", "Penny: You\u2019re not the guy.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? That would explain so much. Your constant presence in my apartment, that baffling dalliance with Leonard just to be near me, the way you call me sweetie all the time.", "Penny: I call everyone sweetie.", "Sheldon: You tramp.", "Penny: Look, Sheldon, all I\u2019m saying is strap on a pair and go talk to Amy.", "Sheldon: Strap on a pair? Of what, skates?", "Penny: Oh, sweetie, you are so not the guy.", "Scene: A cinema.", "Stuart: If you\u2019re bored, you can go. I understand.", "Amy: No, I\u2019m having a nice time.", "Stuart: Don\u2019t patronize me.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hi, Stuart.", "Stuart: Hi, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Pardon me. Excuse me.", "Amy: Sheldon, what are you doing here?", "Sheldon: The thought of you sitting in a darkened theatre with a character like Stuart is repellent. No offence, Stuart.", "Stuart: None taken. Although repellent is kind of a, kind of a strong word.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry this causes you discomfort, but based on the currently established parameters of our relationship, I can put myself in any repellent situation I want.", "Stuart: Um, again\u2026", "Sheldon: Stuart, please. You\u2019re being rude.", "Amy: Anything else?", "Sheldon: I believe I would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship.", "Amy: I\u2019m listening.", "Sheldon: With the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever, physical or otherwise, I would not object to us no longer characterizing you as not my girlfriend.", "Amy: Interesting. Now try it without the quadruple negative.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re being impossible.", "Amy: Hi, Stuart.", "Sheldon: Fine. Amy, will you be my girlfriend?", "Amy: Yes.", "Sheldon: Well, that\u2019s enough of that. Sorry to interrupt. You two enjoy your date. Here\u2019s a dollar for your troubles. Get yourself some Sour Patch Kids.", "Scene: Outside Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Stuart: So, other than you taking your relationship to the next level with another guy, this was nice.", "Amy: Yes, well, thanks for seeing me to my door.", "Stuart: Oh, you\u2019re welcome.", "Sheldon (inside): (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. Let\u2019s wrap things up out there.", "Amy: Um, good night, Stuart.", "Stuart: Good night.", "Sheldon (inside): Take the hint, Stuart. The lady said good night.", "Amy: How did you get into my apartment?", "Sheldon: Wow. Is that the kind of nagging I can expect now that you\u2019re my girlfriend? Good thing I drew this up.", "Amy: What\u2019s that?", "Sheldon: I present to you the relationship agreement. A binding covenant that, in its 31 pages, enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper, here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farrah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.", "Amy: It\u2019s so romantic.", "Sheldon: Mutual indemnification always is. Why don\u2019t you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp.", "Amy: Section 5: Hand-holding. Hand-holding is only allowed under the following circumstances. A: Either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge. B: Either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize. C: Moral support during flu shots. Seems a bit restrictive.", "Sheldon: Feel free to retain a lawyer.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. The girls are playing twister.", "Amy: Penny, I said right hand red.", "Penny (picking up wine): Yeah, I heard you. I got red.", "Amy: Bernadette, left foot yellow.", "Bernadette: We should play limbo next. No one beats me at limbo.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.", "Amy: That\u2019s my boyfriend. It\u2019s open!", "Sheldon: I got a splinter.", "Amy: What do you want me to do about it?", "Sheldon: Relationship agreement Section 4, Boo-boos and Ouchies. You have to take care of it.", "Amy: I should\u2019ve gotten a lawyer.", "Bernadette: Looks like it\u2019s just us playing. (Penny snores) Penny? (Penny snores louder) Penny, we\u2019re out of wine!", "Penny (waking, bleary): You should probably drive."]}
