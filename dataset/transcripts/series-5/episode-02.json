{"series": "5", "episode": "02", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. Leonard is laying out wine and napkins in front of his laptop.", "Sheldon: What are you doing?", "Leonard: Oh, uh, Priya\u2019s calling in a few minutes on Skype, and we are gonna have a dinner date.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s eight o\u2019clock in the morning in Mumbai. How can she have dinner?", "Leonard: Fine, whatever. Priya will be having breakfast.", "Sheldon: All right, so technically it\u2019s not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you\u2019d open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?", "Leonard: That doesn\u2019t sound like mocking.", "Sheldon: You didn\u2019t let me finish. Dinfast (rolls eyes). Are those soy-based candles?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Why?", "Sheldon: Paraffin candles may contain carcinogens. Unless lung cancer is the ambiance you were going for at your dinfast. Dinfast (rolls eyes).", "Leonard: Listen, I don\u2019t want to be rude, but Priya\u2019s gonna be calling any minute, so\u2026", "Sheldon: Oh, yes, Priya. Leonard, you know I make a point of never interfering in your personal affairs.", "Leonard: Yes, I\u2019ve always admired that about you.", "Sheldon: As well you should. But I\u2019m going to make an exception here.", "Leonard: Oh, good.", "Sheldon: Priya has moved back to India to pursue her law career. Instead of desperately trying to keep this intercontinental relationship alive, you could use that time to take up a hobby.", "Leonard: A hobby?", "Sheldon: Yes. I read recently about a fellow in Kansas with an enormous ball of twine. I bet you could give him a run for his money.", "Leonard: You know, some people might say that it\u2019s great that we\u2019re trying to make things work long distance. They\u2019d say things like, love is stronger than the miles between you.", "Sheldon: When I rise to power, those people will be sterilized.", "Leonard: You video-chat with Amy all the time. How is this different?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t you like Amy?", "Leonard: Of course I like Amy.", "Sheldon: Well, there\u2019s the difference. (Skype tone rings)", "Leonard: Excuse me, that\u2019s Priya.", "Priya (on screen): Hi, Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey, honey.", "Priya: I miss you.", "Leonard: Oh, I miss you, too.", "Sheldon: I miss the old days when your romantic partners could be returned to the video store.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Thanks for letting me stay here while Leonard Skypes with his girlfriend.", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s no problem. It\u2019s actually kind of nice. You reading, me reading. We\u2019re like an old married couple.", "Sheldon: If we were an old married couple, the wife would serve iced tea and snickerdoodles.", "Penny: I don\u2019t have iced tea and snickerdoodles.", "Sheldon: A good wife would go to the store.", "Penny: I want a divorce.", "Sheldon: Good. On the way to see the lawyer, pick up some tea and cookies. I must say, I am enjoying your new chair.", "Penny: It\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: It is. Aligns the lumbar, cradles the coccyx, balances the buttocks. This is a chair worthy of the name.", "Penny: What name?", "Sheldon: Chair.", "Penny: Oh, all right, well, I\u2019m glad you like it. I mean, I still can\u2019t get over the fact someone just threw it away.", "Sheldon: What?", "Penny: Yeah, it was just sitting on the street. I paid a homeless guy ten bucks to help me get it up here.", "Sheldon (jumps up): Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. (Starts stripping off clothing)", "Penny: What is wrong?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve been sitting in garbage!", "Penny: Sheldon, take it easy.", "Sheldon: You take it easy! I need to use your shower.", "Penny: I went into this marriage with so much hope.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s a wet Band-Aid on the shower floor. (Runs out of apartment).", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s workshop. ", "Raj: This is fun. I\u2019ve never used a hydraulic thermoforming press before.", "Howard: Pretty sweet, huh? This little baby set the university back 175 grand.", "Leonard: That\u2019s three minutes. Should we see what we got?", "Howard: Hang on.", "Raj: Oh, yeah. This is one good-looking panini.", "Howard: Hand me the tuna melt.", "Leonard: Yep.", "Howard: Thank you. How\u2019s it going with the long-distance love affair?", "Leonard: Not easy, but we\u2019re making it work.", "Howard: When you say making it work, does that include doing the cyber nasty?", "Leonard: What?", "Howard: You know, the virtual pickle tickle. The digital bow-chicka-bow-bow.", "Raj: Come on, dude. This is my sister you\u2019re talking about.", "Howard: Hey, Leonard jiggling his junk at her through a webcam has got to be easier for you to deal with than him actually touching her with it.", "Leonard: There\u2019s no junk jiggling. We just talk.", "Howard: Are you insane? With high-speed Internet, you have at your fingertips the greatest advancement in the field of sex since the invention of the washcloth.", "Leonard: I can\u2019t do that.", "Howard: Well, if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re gonna lose Priya to some fancy guy in a turban who grew up with Kama Sutra coloring books.", "Raj: How can you be so racist?", "Howard: Oh, come on, tell me I\u2019m wrong.", "Sheldon (entering): Oh, Leonard, good. There you are. I need you to check my head for chair lice.", "Leonard: I did it last night, I\u2019m not doing it again.", "Howard: Just his head, right?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it. You didn\u2019t catch bugs from Penny\u2019s chair.", "Sheldon: Yes, I did. And now they\u2019re cavorting at the base of my hair follicles like dancing hippies at the Redwood National Forest.", "Leonard: Sheldon, you do this all the time. You fixate on some crazy idea and then blow it way out of proportion.", "Sheldon: Name one time I\u2019ve ever done that.", "Leonard: How about when you put GPS trackers in your garbage because you were convinced North Korean spies were stealing your doodles? The chicken nuggets you were sure were human nuggets. The strangely-shaped cloud that was following you around town. The time you put on my shirt by mistake and were convinced you\u2019d started growing again.", "Sheldon: I said, name one. You really need to work on your listening skills.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment door.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: Yello.", "Sheldon: You need to remove that chair from the building. It\u2019s a health hazard.", "Penny: Okay, relax. I took off the slipcovers, had them dry-cleaned and then fumigated the cushions.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Penny: Yeah. It\u2019s cleaner than my couch. Found half a Hot Pocket in there.", "Sheldon: It certainly looks okay. Has a strong toxic chemical smell. That\u2019s reassuring.", "Penny: Why don\u2019t you give it a try, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: All right. It is a comfortable chair.", "Penny: Why don\u2019t you just admit you overreacted?", "Sheldon: No, thank you. (Sees insect. More appear and swarm all over him. He jumps out of a daydream on his own couch. Jumps up and runs out to Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: It\u2019s like living with a Chihuahua.", "Sheldon (at Penny\u2019s door): (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: What\u2019s up, buttercup?", "Sheldon: You have to get rid of the chair.", "Penny: Nope. (Closes door) ", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: What\u2019s the word, hummingbird?", "Sheldon: For your safety, please wait in my apartment as I call the authorities so they may remove the chair of death.", "Penny: No. (Closes door)", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: What\u2019s the gist, physicist?", "Sheldon: Under my authority as a self-appointed member of the Centres for Disease Control street team, these premises are condemned. (Penny tries to close door) As a man with a keen sense of style, I must tell you, that chair does not work with the room. (Penny closes door). (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door and waves seat cushion at him. He screams and runs off. She closes door. He sneaks back) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.", "Leonard: So, here we are. Back in bed together.", "Priya (on laptop screen): Yep, here we are.", "Leonard: Okay, so I, I, I guess I\u2019ll just jump right in.", "Priya: All right.", "Leonard: Uh, you\u2019re a naughty girl. And, and, uh, I, I want to punish you with my love?", "Priya: What?", "Leonard: Not good?", "Priya: That\u2019s terrible. Try again.", "Leonard: Okay. Uh, uh, you\u2019re not naughty. Uh, you\u2019re, you\u2019re, you\u2019re dirty. You\u2019re, you\u2019re a, a dirty girl?", "Priya: Oh, yes. Yes, I am.", "Leonard: Yeah, yeah. Uh, okay. You\u2019re a, you\u2019re a, you\u2019re a, a dirty, disgusting, revolting girl. Ugh!", "Priya: God, Leonard, stop talking.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t you just give me five minutes? I\u2019ll Google how to do this. I\u2019ll call you right back.", "Priya: Shh-shh-shh. Just be quiet and do what I tell you.", "Leonard: Okay, like usual. Good.", "Priya: Take off your shirt.", "Leonard: All rightie. Shirt coming off. Ta-da! Man nipples.", "Priya: I said be quiet.", "Leonard: Yes, ma\u2019am.", "Priya: Now take off your shorts.", "Leonard: Taking shorts off. There we go. Naked, naked, naked!", "Priya: Wonderful. Now I\u2019ll take off my clothes.", "Leonard: Cool. (computer screen bugs out) Uh-oh!", "Priya: Here I am, baby. You miss these?", "Leonard: Oh, damn it!", "Priya: Oh, Leonard! Already?", "Leonard: No, no! No-no-no! The screen froze. It\u2019s probably just buffering, just give it a second.", "Priya: Fine.", "Leonard: So, how are your mom and dad?", "Priya: Yeah, I really don\u2019t want to talk about my parents now.", "Leonard: Yeah. Sure, sure.", "Sheldon (calling from outside): If your video\u2019s frozen, try resetting the TCP/IP stack.", "Leonard: Oh! I didn\u2019t even think of that. Thanks.", "Sheldon (still off): You\u2019re welcome. Please let me know when you and your girlfriend are done hogging the bandwidth for your self-abuse. I\u2019m trying to stream a movie on Netflix in here.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment. Amy is playing a harp.", "Amy: Five, six, seven, eight. Tall and tan and young and lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking, and when she passes, each one she passes goes\u2026", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy. (Knock, knock, knock) Amy.", "Amy: Oh\u2026 You are aware that your ritualistic knocking behaviour is symptomatic of obsessive compulsive disorder?", "Sheldon: Is not. Is not, is not.", "Amy: Denial. Denial, denial. Come in.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: Would you like to hear me play a bossa nova standard on the harp?", "Sheldon: No.", "Amy: How about the theme song to the classic television show Diff\u2019rent Strokes? Now the world don\u2019t move to the beat\u2026", "Sheldon: No.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s every song I know. What\u2019s up?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re good friends with Penny, right?", "Amy: Best friends, besties, BFFs, peas in a pod, sisters who would share travelling pants. Go on.", "Sheldon: I was hoping she might listen to you about the dangers of owning unhygienic furniture.", "Amy: For general educational purposes, or has she acquired a bar stool dipped in cholera?", "Sheldon: Cholera is water-borne. You\u2019re mocking me.", "Amy: Yes, I am.", "Sheldon: Penny has dragged a chair in off the street whose unknown provenance jeopardizes the health and welfare of every resident in our building.", "Amy: Sheldon, just because you have a focus on cleanliness bordering on the psychotic doesn\u2019t mean I have to participate.", "Sheldon: All right, name your price.", "Amy: Kiss me where I\u2019ve never been kissed before.", "Sheldon: You mean like Salt Lake City?", "Amy: Never mind. I\u2019ll talk to Penny.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: Will you listen to me play my harp now?", "Sheldon: No. I dislike the sound of the harp. Its overuse in classic television sitcoms always makes me think I\u2019m going to experience an episode from my past. (Amy plays glissando) I\u2019m sorry, Mommy. Don\u2019t be mad at me. Don\u2019t do that!", "Scene: Howard\u2019s workshop. ", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know about this, Howard.", "Howard: What? You\u2019re having trouble with the long-distance lovemaking. This is your answer. There are two interfaces that simulate a human mouth. You have one, Priya has one in India. When you move your lips and tongue on yours, it transmits exactly what you\u2019re doing to hers. See? Internet kissing. (Howard kisses device) Give it a try.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think so.", "Raj: I\u2019ll try it. Like this?", "Howard: Almost. Really get your tongue in there, to activate the motion sensor.", "Raj: Like this?", "Howard: Close. Really French it.", "Raj: Better?", "Howard: Yeah, you got it, you got it.", "Raj: I\u2019m impressed. This is very lifelike.", "Howard: Whoa! You just bit my tongue!", "Raj: I, I nibbled. I was being playful.", "Howard: Why do you have to make everything weird?", "Raj: Sorry. Better?", "Howard: Oh, yeah.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: Pretty cool, huh? Probably would cost, like, two hundred bucks in a store.", "Amy: I do appreciate a bargain. This entire ensemble once belonged to my dead grandmother.", "Penny: You\u2019re kidding.", "Amy: Everything except bra and panties. And they\u2019re a leopard-spotted secret I share with Victoria.", "Penny: And now me.", "Amy: I just have one question about the chair.", "Penny: And what\u2019s that?", "Amy: Aren\u2019t you worried about it being unhygienic?", "Penny: No, it\u2019s completely fine. Hmm. I get it. Sheldon sent you. He put you up to this.", "Amy: No, he didn\u2019t.", "Penny: Really?", "Amy: Yes, he did. He absolutely did.", "Penny: My God, Amy, that\u2019s really crappy of you.", "Amy: It is?", "Penny: Yeah! Letting Sheldon use you to manipulate me? I thought you were my friend.", "Amy: No, I am your friend. Please don\u2019t be mad at me.", "Penny: I can\u2019t even believe this. You know, maybe you should just go.", "Amy: No, no, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. I take it all back. Look. I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m sitting in your chair. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it. It\u2019s a great chair. Please let me continue to be part of your world. Ow!", "Penny: What\u2019s wrong?", "Amy: Something in the chair\u2019s biting my tushy. It\u2019s not important. Ow!", "Penny: Wait. Get up, get up! (She does. Something is moving in the seat cushion. They both run out of the apartment screaming.) Swear you won\u2019t tell Sheldon what happened!", "Amy (between screams): I swear! Can I tell my doctor? I\u2019m probably gonna need shots!", "Penny (also still screaming): Yeah, sure!", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. ", "Leonard: Oh, hey, babe, I think I figured this thing out.", "Priya (on screen): Oh, Leonard, listen\u2026", "Leonard: No, you listen. You\u2019re my woman, and I\u2019m gonna make you feel things you have never felt before.", "Priya: Leonard\u2026", "Leonard: That\u2019s right, say my name, and beg me for more, \u2019cause, I\u2019m gonna give it to you.", "Priya: My parents are here.", "Dr Koothrappali: Hello, Leonard, if I may also say your name.", "Scene: The street outside the apartment block.", "Howard: Check it out. Free chair.", "Raj: Yeah. Hey, you know, if this was in Sheldon and Leonard\u2019s apartment, I wouldn\u2019t wind up sitting on the floor all the time.", "Howard: On three?", "Together: Three!", "Raj: What kind of idiot throws away a terrific chair like this?"]}
