{"series": "5", "episode": "09", "transcript": [" Scene: The lobby.", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: Oh, hey. You work the lunch shift?", "Penny: Yeah. I\u2019ve got eight pounds of salmon that\u2019s about to go bad. Do you know how to cook it?", "Leonard: Not really.", "Penny: Damn it. Should have liberated the iffy chicken. What are you and Professor Fussyface up to tonight?", "Leonard: Star Wars on Blu-ray.", "Penny: Haven\u2019t you seen that movie, like, a thousand times?", "Leonard: Not on Blu-ray. Only twice on Blu-ray.", "Penny: Oh, Leonard.", "Leonard: I know, it\u2019s high-resolution sadness.", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m going to take myself out to a movie tonight. You want to go?", "Leonard: Really? Do we do that?", "Penny: What do you mean?", "Leonard: You know, we haven\u2019t spent time alone together since we broke up.", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s not a date, Leonard. It\u2019s just a man and a woman hanging out, and not having sex at the end of the night.", "Leonard: Sounds like most of my dates.", "Sheldon (off, voice heard through apartment door as they approach): Oh, dear Lord, get away from me, you monster!", "Penny: What is that about?", "Leonard: Well, he\u2019s smart and crazy enough, he may have actually created a monster. (They enter. Sheldon is by the window.)", "Sheldon: Shoo, shoo! Be gone!", "Leonard: What the hell is going on?", "Sheldon: There\u2019s a bird outside the window, and he won\u2019t go away. That is the hell that is going on. We have no worms or seeds here. Shoo, shoo.", "Penny: Really? On top of everything else, you\u2019re afraid of birds?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s called ornithophobia. And someday it will be recognized as a true disability, and the landlord will be required by law to put a giant net over the building. Which is unfortunate, because I have a fear of nets.", "Penny: So movies, yes or no?", "Leonard: Movies, yes.", "Penny: Great. I\u2019ll see you later. And remember, he\u2019s more afraid of you than you are of him.", "Sheldon: That doesn\u2019t help.", "Penny: No, I was talking to the bird.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird. (Knock, knock, knock) Go away, bird.", "Leonard: Sheldon, just ignore him.", "Sheldon: Good idea. Attention is what birds want. (Pulls curtain) Oh, much better. All right. Now I\u2019ll just get along with my life. (Bird squawks) Make a pot of tea, Leonard. It\u2019s going to be a long night.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.Sheldon is trying to scare the bird away making cat noises.", "Leonard: The bird\u2019s still there?", "Sheldon: Quick, what does a hawk sound like?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Scree-scree.", "Sheldon: Please, that\u2019s a seagull. If you\u2019re not going to help, don\u2019t help.", "Leonard: Sorry. Do you think I\u2019m overdressed?", "Sheldon: It depends on the activity. For a prostate exam, yes. If you\u2019re playing Vegas, I\u2019d add sequins.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going to the movies with Penny. I don\u2019t want her to think that I think it\u2019s a date.", "Sheldon: Do you think it\u2019s a date?", "Leonard: No, but she might think I think it\u2019s a date even though I don\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Or you might think she thinks you think it\u2019s a date even though she doesn\u2019t.", "Leonard: Are we overthinking this?", "Sheldon: Not at all.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m wearing this.", "Sheldon: Really? A blazer? All right. (Leonard takes off blazer and heads back to his room. Sheldon dials phone) Yes, hello. This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Yeah, I\u2019m at 2311 North Robles Avenue. Yeah, I\u2019d like to report a dangerous wild animal. A blue jay. I\u2019m sorry, this is Animal Control. I don\u2019t understand the laughter. No, the bird is not in my home. If he was in my home, I obviously would have called 911. Sir, I have no doubt that there are things that you\u2019re frightened of. Being stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or your wife stepping out on you because you\u2019re stuck in a dead-end public service job? Or spiders? Don\u2019t you think I tried making cat noises?", "Leonard (returning in a tee shirt and backwards cap): Too casual?", "Sheldon: For an audience with the queen, yes. For an evening of passing a bottle of fortified wine around a flaming trash can, you look great. (Leonard leaves again. Sheldon draws a picture of a cats face and returns to making cat noises at the window.) What am I thinking? Whiskers!", "Scene: The cinema.", "Penny: Oh, hey, if we hurry, we can make the new Jennifer Aniston movie.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah, sure. There\u2019s also an amazing documentary about building a dam on river in South America.", "Penny: Okay, but the Jennifer Aniston movie has Jennifer Aniston, and she\u2019s not building a dam.", "Leonard: Can\u2019t argue with that. I\u2019ll get the tickets.", "Penny: Okay.", "Leonard: Actually, you know what? I think it\u2019s about time I pick a movie we see.", "Penny: You pick plenty of movies.", "Leonard: No. You always picked, and it was always the same. An hour and a half of beach houses in the rain until the woman turns around and realizes love was here all along.", "Penny: But come on, that is a great movie, and it starts in ten minutes.", "Leonard: I hate those movies.", "Penny: No, you don\u2019t.", "Leonard: Yes, I do. The only reason I went is because you wanted to see them, and I wanted to have sex. To this day, I can\u2019t see a Sandra Bullock movie poster without getting both bored and aroused.", "Penny: Okay, so while we were going out, how often would you pretend to like things just to have sex with me?", "Leonard: All the time.", "Penny: You\u2019re kidding.", "Leonard: Does this sound familiar? I\u2019d love to go shoe shopping with you. Hiking? It\u2019s great. It\u2019s two a.m., of course I want to go to Korea Town and sing karaoke with your friends. Who wouldn\u2019t?", "Penny: Okay, we were going out. You were going to get sex anyway.", "Leonard: Really? You would have slept with me after a three-hour documentary on dams?", "Penny: No. No woman would.", "Leonard: See? Now, that\u2019s the great thing. We\u2019re out as friends. This is not a date. Sex is off the table. So, let\u2019s go learn why hydroelectric power might not be the environmental bargain you think it is. Sorry. Spoiler alert.", "Penny: All right, fine.", "Leonard: Thanks. Tickets are eleven bucks. Not a date.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Come on, Sheldon, Star Wars.", "Howard: I\u2019m pushing play.", "Sheldon: A minute.", "Howard: If we don\u2019t start soon, George Lucas is going to change it again.", "Sheldon: This would go a lot faster if you put your trade school diploma to work and helped me set up this high frequency tone generator.", "Howard: I have a Masters degree from M.I.T.", "Sheldon: Yeah, but you\u2019ve got a can-do attitude and that\u2019s what\u2019s important.", "Raj: I really don\u2019t get your problem with birds.", "Sheldon: The question you should be asking is what is their problem with me? My first memory, a hummingbird dive-bombing my stroller to get at the apple juice in my sippy cup.", "Raj: Hummingbirds are pretty.", "Sheldon: Hummingbirds are the vampires of the flower world.", "Raj: Still my first choice for an ankle tattoo. Or a dolphin, I go back and forth.", "Sheldon: Age seven, a blood-thirsty chicken chases me up a tree. Age twelve, a magpie tries to steal the retainer out of my mouth. Age sixteen, a parrot in a pet store called me fat ass. Need I go on?", "Raj: Yes, please. This is way better than the movie.", "Howard: All right, Sheldon, your bird death ray is ready.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not a death ray. It\u2019s just a little ultrasonic blast to scare him off. Trust me, if I had a death ray, I wouldn\u2019t be living here. I\u2019d be in my lair enjoying the money the people of Earth gave me for not using my death ray. All right, and in three, two, one. (Switches on. All the windows shatter. The bird doesn\u2019t move.)", "Raj: That is one tough birdie.", "Scene: A bar.", "Leonard: Come on, you enjoyed the movie. I saw you tearing up when the village got flooded, and everyone had to relocate.", "Penny: No, I was thinking how come they get to leave and I can\u2019t.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going to get some fries. You want anything?", "Penny: Uh, no, thanks.", "Leonard: Are you sure? Because you always say no, and then you eat half my fries.", "Penny: I just eat the little crispy ones you don\u2019t like.", "Leonard: No, I love them. I save them for the end, but they\u2019re gone because you ate them. And why did I let you eat them?", "Penny: To get sex.", "Leonard: Exactly. But this is not a date. So I ask again, would you like anything?", "Penny: All right, I\u2019d like an order of fries.", "Leonard: Great. That\u2019ll be five dollars. I am having the best time. I\u2019m so glad you suggested we do this.", "Penny (accidentally nudging the man sitting behind her): Oh, sorry.", "Man: No problem.", "Penny: What you writing there?", "Man: A screenplay. Its about a guy whose roommate is having sex and tells him go to a bar and work on his screenplay.", "Penny: I Hope Alex Gets Crabs: The Movie.", "Man: It\u2019s a working title.", "Penny: Oh.", "Man: I\u2019m Kevin.", "Penny: Oh. Penny. Nice to meet you.", "Kevin: I\u2019ll let you get back to your date.", "Penny: Oh, no, no. This isn\u2019t a date, no. Right?", "Leonard: Uh, right.", "Penny: So have you written anything I might have seen?", "Kevin: That depends. How much time do you spend on Yelp?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m a grown man from Texas. This isn\u2019t a terrifying bird like a swan or a goose. It\u2019s just a blue jay. (Opens window) That\u2019s a pretty big blue jay. (Closes window. Goes to cabinet. Comes out wearing a Boba Fett helmet and a broom) One, two, three. (Opens window) Go! Shoo! Am-scray, ird-bay! (Bird flies in window) Bird in the apartment! Bird in the apartment! (Sees the bird sitting in his place) No!", "Scene: The bar.", "Penny (to Kevin): So it is an amazing documentary. They need the electricity from the dam, but at the same time they want to preserve the environment.", "Leonard: You\u2019re kidding me. Uh, can I see you for a sec over here?", "Penny: Oh, yeah. Sure. Just one sec?", "Kevin: No problem.", "Penny: What\u2019s up?", "Leonard: I know what you\u2019re doing.", "Penny: What am I doing?", "Leonard: You\u2019re going out of your way to talk to that guy because I said we weren\u2019t on a date.", "Penny: No, I\u2019m talking to him because he\u2019s cute.", "Leonard: Come on, he\u2019s not that cute.", "Penny: Yes, he is. With his dorky T-shirt and his little hipster glasses.", "Leonard: I wear dorky T-shirts and glasses.", "Penny: Yes, but when you\u2019re tall and have great cheekbones, you\u2019re doing it ironically.", "Leonard: If that\u2019s so, what if I start talking to a girl?", "Penny: You should.", "Leonard: I\u2019m serious. I\u2019ll do it.", "Penny: Good! Go! There are some girls right over there. What are you waiting for?", "Leonard: They\u2019re in a group. I\u2019m scared.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Sheldon, what do you expect us to do?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re biologists. Biology is the study of living things. That\u2019s a living thing, get cracking.", "Bernadette: I specialize in microorganisms, and Amy studies brains.", "Amy: Yeah, neither of us minored in bird-shooing.", "Sheldon: Oh, come now. Your undergraduate work must have included a varmints and critters class.", "Bernadette: Come back in, Sheldon, he\u2019s not going to hurt you. He looks friendly. I think he might be someone\u2019s pet.", "Sheldon: No, Bernadette, don\u2019t be a hero!", "Bernadette: Oh, he\u2019s a sweetie.", "Sheldon: Yes. It\u2019s very sweet. Now, slowly and carefully, flush him down the toilet.", "Amy: Sheldon, the only way to get past this fear is to interact with it. Just like you did with the mailman.", "Sheldon: Every year tens of people around the world are killed by birds. I\u2019m not going to be another statistic.", "Bernadette: Look how sweet he is. Come over and say hi. Come on. You can do it. Don\u2019t be scared. Come on. Oh, just pet the bird, you big baby!", "Sheldon: I did it! I actually did it. Okay, now flush him.", "Scene: The bar.", "Woman: So, Leonard, what do you do for fun?", "Leonard: Um, let\u2019s see. Hiking. Karaoke in Koreatown. Any Jennifer Aniston movie.", "Penny: Hey. Sorry I ditched you.", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s fine. You can ditch away.", "Penny: Oh, no, no. We said we were going to hang out, let\u2019s hang out.", "Leonard: It\u2019s cool. Go back to Kevin.", "Penny: Oh, he had to leave.", "Leonard: Interesting. So now that he\u2019s gone, you want to hang out with me.", "Woman: This must be Penny.", "Leonard: Yep.", "Woman: I totally get it.", "Penny: Huh? I\u2019m sorry, get what?", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry about it. You know, there\u2019s some guys over there. You should go talk to them.", "Penny: No, no. I want to know what you told her.", "Leonard: That\u2019s kind of between me and\u2026", "Woman: Laura.", "Leonard: Laura.", "Penny: Oh. Okay, I see. So while he was telling you things, did he mention he owns not one, but two Star Trek uniforms?", "Laura: Really?", "Penny: Yeah. Wears them. Not just for Halloween.", "Leonard: Hey, pal. You didn\u2019t see me telling Kevin that you thought cold wars were only fought in winter.", "Penny: Okay. Then I\u2019ll return the favour, and I won\u2019t tell\u2026", "Laura: Laura.", "Penny: Laura that half the dirty movies you own are animated.", "Leonard: When you were telling Kevin about your acting career, did you mention your long-running role as Waitress in a local production of The Cheesecake Factory?", "Penny: Did you tell her about your lucky asthma inhaler?", "Leonard: Oh, yeah? Spell asthma.", "Penny: A\u2026 S\u2026 Take me home.", "Leonard: Maybe I\u2019m not done hanging out with\u2026 (Laura has gone) You\u2019re right, it\u2019s getting late.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the bird on his arm.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s remarkable. All that time spent in fear. And for what? He\u2019s magnificent. Oh, dear. I just realized I haven\u2019t offered you a beverage.", "Bernadette: Oh, it\u2019s just like my grandma with her parrot. And after she lost her marbles with her remote control.", "Sheldon: My phone\u2019s on the desk over there. Take a picture of us together. Make it good enough to go on a mug, a mouse pad, and a calendar. If you were a dove, I\u2019d call you Lovey-Dovey. Oh. Who am I kidding? This isn\u2019t a moment for strict adherence to the literal. You\u2019re just my little Lovey-Dovey, aren\u2019t you?", "Amy: Guess you gotta have hollow bones to get some sugar around here.", "Bernadette: I still think he looks like someone\u2019s pet. Maybe we should put up posters.", "Sheldon: Yes. It should have a big picture of him, and the words, is this your bird? Not anymore. We\u2019re going to have so much fun together. You can carry messages to all my enemies. I can tie a string to your leg and fly you like a kite.", "Amy: If you\u2019re keeping him, I\u2019ve got a cage you can borrow. One of the test monkeys slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck. It was both tragic and hysterical.", "Sheldon: Nonsense. No. Lovey-Dovey doesn\u2019t sleep in a cage. No. Lovey-Dovey sleeps in his very own nest, which I\u2019m going to get off the windowsill and put in my room. Isn\u2019t that right, LD? (Opens window. Bird flies out.) No. Where are you going? Come back, Lovey-Dovey! This is your home now! I already ordered 20 pounds of bird feed off of Amazon! He\u2019s gone.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: How could he do this to me? Get back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you!", "Scene: The stairwell. They ascend without talking.", "Leonard: Okay. So, we went out, saw a movie, met some nice people, said horrible things about each other in public, all in all, a pretty magical night.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m not innocent in all this, but you basically called me stupid, you asthmatic dumbass.", "Leonard: I know, I, I, I crossed a line. And I\u2019m sorry. No, no, no, hang on. I really mean it. And it\u2019s not like when we were going out, I\u2019d just apologize for everything so we could end up in bed. This is a 100% sex-is-off-the-table I\u2019m sorry.", "Penny: All right. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry, too.", "Leonard: Just to be clear, sex is off the table, right?", "Penny: Way off.", "Leonard: Maybe we\u2019re not ready to hang out as friends.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. Up until the last part, I was kind of enjoying take-charge Leonard with a little backbone. Picking the movie, knowing what he wants, a little cocky.", "Leonard: Really?", "Penny: Yeah.", "Leonard: Well, then, I\u2019m putting sex back on the table. What do you think about that?", "Penny: Ooh. Maybe I like it.", "Leonard: You do? Because if that\u2019s what you like, I can be that guy. I swear, I\u2019ll be anything you want me to be.", "Penny: Good night, Leonard.", "Leonard: I am such an asthmatic dumbass. I had a weird night.", "Sheldon: Mine was great. I\u2019m going to be a mommy. (Reveals nest with an egg in it.)"]}
