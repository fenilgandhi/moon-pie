I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.", "Amy: Hang on, Dr. C. What\u2019s vexillology?", "Sheldon: Vexillology is the study of flags.", "Amy: Cool. I think I just learned something.", "Sheldon: Did you have fun doing it?", "Amy: I\u2019ll say.", "Sheldon: Fun and information are two sides to this video podcast, not unlike the only two-sided state flag, Oregon. Oh, look. Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we\u2019ll answer some burning questions. What\u2019s the only non-rectangular flag? What animal appears most often on flags? What animal appears second most often on flags? And more.", "Amy: Sweet!", "Sheldon: Why are you waving a white flag?", "Amy: I\u2019m surrendering to fun.", "Sheldon: Now, today\u2019s episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important. Flags: you gotta know how to hold \u2019em, you gotta know how to fold \u2019em. Let\u2019s start by identifying the parts of our flag. This edge is the hoist, and it\u2019s used to\u2026", "Leonard: Excuse me, sorry, excuse me.", "Sheldon: Cut. Did you not see we are rolling?", "Leonard: Sorry. I\u2019m having dinner with Penny. I have to get out of here.", "Sheldon: And I have flag knowledge that I have to get out of here!", "Amy: You okay?", "Sheldon: No, I\u2019m a little rattled. But like the flag over Fort Sumter, I\u2019m still here. And, take two. Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper, and welcome to the premiere episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags. Over the next 52 weeks, you and I are going to explore the dynamic world of vexillology.", "Amy: Hang on, Dr. Cooper. What\u2019s vexillology?", "Sheldon: Vexillology is\u2026 why is there a face on that flag?", "Amy: It\u2019s Ferdinand T. Flag. I thought he might help bring in some younger viewers.", "Sheldon: Confound it! You\u2019re right, it\u2019s brilliant. Let\u2019s take it from the top.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: That was a really nice dinner. I\u2019m glad you asked me out again.", "Leonard: Me, too, I missed you.", "Penny: You see me all the time. You sure you just don\u2019t miss the sex?", "Leonard: Well, yeah, sex with you is pretty great. Have you ever tried it?", "Penny: I have. You are not wrong. I just think if we\u2019re gonna try dating again, we should take things slow.", "Leonard: Oh, I can take it slow. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend in high school, Karen Berberick? To this day she doesn\u2019t know we were going out. Made it easier on her when I broke things off.", "Penny: Okay, well, maybe not that slow.", "Leonard: How about this, are you familiar with the typical development for computer software?", "Penny: You know, just for fun, let\u2019s say I\u2019m not.", "Leonard: Before an application is released, they give it a trial run. W-We could do that. And if we hit a rough spot, instead of getting mad, just say, hey, we found a bug, and we report it so it can be fixed.", "Penny: You mean like a beta test?", "Leonard: Well, technically, this would be an alpha test. A beta test requires people that weren\u2019t involved in the development of the appli\u2026", "Penny: Seriously, do I not get credit for knowing beta test?", "Leonard: No, you should. Absolutely. That was me being pedantic. That\u2019s our first bug. You reported it. I can fix that. See? This is good.", "Penny: All right. Let\u2019s give it a shot.", "Leonard: Great. You keep a list, I\u2019ll keep a list. At some point, we\u2019ll exchange.", "Penny: Okay. Good night, Leonard.", "Leonard: Night. Attaboy, Hofstadter. Nothing gets the ladies hotter than software development analogies. Hey, I\u2019m back.", "Sheldon: Cut! Take 47.", "Scene: Sheldon and Raj\u2019s office.", "Sheldon: Here\u2019s an interesting fact about flags.", "Raj: I will take that action.", "Sheldon: The flags of Liechtenstein and Haiti were identical by coincidence, a fact that wasn\u2019t discovered until they competed against each other at the 1936 Olympics. And thankfully, their embarrassment was overshadowed by the rise of Fascism.", "Howard: Let\u2019s see the new phone.", "Raj: I stopped on the way to work. Hey, do you want to peel the plastic off with me?", "Howard: Really? Me? That\u2019s, like, the best part.", "Raj: Grab a corner. Whoa, what\u2019s your hurry, cowboy? Savour the moment.", "Howard: Oh, yeah.", "Sheldon: Speaking of cowboys, do you know what country has not one but two cows on its flag? The tiny landlocked nation of Andorra. Oh, the next classic episode of Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun with Flags is writing itself.", "Howard: Oh, let me try the voice recognition.", "Raj: Hey, I let you peel the plastic, don\u2019t get greedy. (To phone) Hello?", "Phone: Hello.", "Raj: What\u2019s your name?", "Phone: My name is Siri.", "Howard: Look at that. There\u2019s finally a woman in your life you can talk to.", "Raj: Are you single?", "Siri: I don\u2019t have a marital status, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.", "Raj: Yeah, you\u2019re right, that\u2019s too personal. We hardly know each other. How about a cup of coffee?", "Siri: I\u2019ve found six coffee shops. Three of them are fairly close to you.", "Raj: I will see you gentlemen later.", "Howard: She is gonna break his heart.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: For someone who has a machine that can travel anywhere in time and space, Doctor Who sure does have a thing for modern-day London.", "Sheldon: Careful, it\u2019s that kind of sass that can get a person uninvited to this year\u2019s Who Con.", "Penny: Uh, we\u2019re not counting this as a date, are we?", "Leonard: Um, I\u2019m not sure, but I think the right answer here is no.", "Penny: Bug report: When a guy asks me to spend time with him, maybe he plans something a little more interesting than hanging out at home, watching TV.", "Leonard: Even Doctor Who?", "Penny: Even Doctor Who.", "Sheldon: All right, that\u2019s it. Who Con, you\u2019re out.", "Leonard: Okay, bug report taken. Next time I will have a better plan for our evening\u2019s activity.", "Penny: Well, thank you. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.", "Leonard: Oh, wait, here, almost forgot. Here.", "Penny: What\u2019s this?", "Leonard: My bug report to you.", "Penny: Well, that\u2019s quite a list you got there.", "Leonard: It\u2019s colour coded.", "Penny: Oh.", "Leonard: Uh, red means fix right away. Yellow is eh, whenever you get a chance. And green is I could probably learn to live with it. There\u2019s a key down here at the bottom. It\u2019s neat, huh?", "Penny: Yep.", "Leonard: So, have a good night.", "Penny: Yep.", "Leonard: Look at that. Some day, we will tell future generations that dating used to be hard.", "Amy: What\u2019s baffling me is what you could\u2019ve possibly put on the list. Hair too golden? Laugh too musical? World too much a better place for her mere presence in it?", "Sheldon: How about constantly talks with food in her mouth?", "Amy: Her heart\u2019s full of love, no one cares what\u2019s in her mouth.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: So, Siri, what\u2019s happening? How are you?", "Siri: I am well.", "Raj: What are you doing right now?", "Siri: What am I doing? I\u2019m talking with you.", "Raj: You have a beautiful voice.", "Siri: Thank you, it\u2019s nice to be appreciated.", "Raj: I bet it is. Why don\u2019t women like me?", "Siri: Let me check on that. How about a Web search for why don\u2019t women like me?\u201d", "Raj: No need. I\u2019ve already done that. Siri, do you have a last name?", "Siri: My name is Siri.", "Raj: Ah, one name. Like, uh, Cher, Madonna, Adele. All the women who rock me. My name is Rajesh, but you can call me Raj.", "Siri: Would you like me to call you Raj?", "Raj: I\u2019d like you to call me sexy.", "Siri: From now on, I\u2019ll call you sexy. Okay?", "Raj: Okay.", "Scene: Sheldon and Raj\u2019s office.", "Siri, I\u2019m in the mood for gelato.", "Siri: (chimes) I found ten restaurants whose reviews mention gelato. Seven of them are fairly close to you.", "Raj: Thank you, darling.", "Siri: You are most certainly welcome, sexy.", "Sheldon: Well done, Dr. Koothrappali.", "Raj: I\u2019m sorry?", "Sheldon: You\u2019ve taken a great evolutionary leap by abandoning human interaction and allowing yourself to romantically bond with a soulless machine. Kudos.", "Raj: I haven\u2019t bonded with it.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, of course. I understand. You\u2019re afraid the world isn\u2019t ready for your taboo love. Your secret\u2019s safe with me.", "Raj: It\u2019s just a phone.", "Barry Kripke: Cooper.", "Sheldon: Kripke.", "Barry: Heads up. Pwofessor Wothman urinated in the particle physics wab again, so we\u2019re going to move up his wetirement party. Fwiday, five o\u2019cwock, pot wuck.", "Raj: Thanks, Barry. Siri, remind me Friday morning to make my famous popovers.", "Siri: All right, I\u2019ll remind you.", "Barry (to his own phone): You got Siwi, huh? Voice wecognition on that thing is tewible. Wook. Siwi, can you wecommend a westauwant?", "Barry\u2019s Siri: I\u2019m sorry, Bawwy. I don\u2019t understand wecommend a westauwant.", "Barry: Wisten to me. Not westauwant, westauwant.", "Barry\u2019s Siri: I don\u2019t know what you mean by not westauwant, westauwant.", "Barry: See? Total cwap. You suck, Siwi.", "Raj: Hey, don\u2019t talk to her like that. She\u2019s a lady.", "Barry: Well, that wady took high-wes pictures of my junk wast night for Cwaigswist. Waiter.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment door. Leonard knocks.", "Penny: It\u2019s open.", "Leonard: Hey. You ready to go?", "Penny: Yeah, hang on. Let me just finish this chapter.", "Leonard: Can you finish it later?", "Penny: No, I can\u2019t. Reading books is a big part of my life now because, you know, we\u2019d have more fun things to talk about if I read more.", "Leonard: Great. Good. Great. What are you reading?", "Penny: Two Weeks to Rock Hard Abs.", "Leonard: They kind of spoil the ending right in the name of that, don\u2019t they? All right. Look, just remember how this works. We don\u2019t get mad about these things. Uh, speaking of which, I\u2019ve addressed your bug report on my date planning. Got a really fun evening for you. It\u2019s kind of a surprise.", "Penny: All right. Terrific. Well, let me just go find a pair of shoes that aren\u2019t so tall. We wouldn\u2019t want you to feel like you were out for a walk with your mommy.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Penny: Yeah. Oh. Here\u2019s my list for you, right there.", "Leonard: All right, fair enough. I certainly can be quieter when we kiss. I thought it was an expression of passion, but if it\u2019s coming across as juicy and weird, who wants that? Uh, uh, I\u2019m sorry, can you be more specific on how my eyebrows are stupid? Nah, never mind, it\u2019s right here.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: Good timing. Dinner\u2019s almost ready.", "Howard: Great.", "Bernadette: Oh, smells amazing in here.", "Howard: Yeah, what are we eating?", "Raj: Oh, an exotic little treat. I was just talking to Siri about Peking duck, and she said she knew about four Chinese grocers, two of which were fairly close to me. Her spontaneity is contagious.", "Bernadette: Who\u2019s Siri? Is he dating somebody new?", "Howard: Yes. His phone.", "Bernadette: Oh. Is that cute or creepy?", "Howard: Uh-huh.", "Raj: Can I pour you some wine? I think you\u2019ll enjoy it. The traditional choice with Peking duck is a Sauvignon Blanc, but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling. I wasn\u2019t sure, but I didn\u2019t want to have an argument with her in the middle of Trader Joe\u2019s. Now, what should we put Siri in for dinner? Leopard, sparkles, or to paraphrase Coco Chanel, you can never go wrong with a little black case. Siri, play some smooth jazz.", "Siri: Playing smooth jazz.", "Raj: Oh, my God, Kenny G? This woman can read me like a book. I can\u2019t believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know if I want to stay.", "Scene: A shooting range.", "Penny: This is amazing. How did you even get this idea?", "Leonard: I called your dad. I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid. This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.", "Penny: Okay, you\u2019re kind of really great.", "Leonard: You mean for a person whose neck massages feel like an eagle is trying to carry you to its nest?", "Penny: Okay, bug report. I just complimented you. You should take it and shut up.", "Leonard: Right. Sorry, sorry.", "Penny: And stop apologizing all the time.", "Leonard: Right. Sorry.", "Penny: All right, let\u2019s shoot stuff. You want me to show you what to do?", "Leonard: I play a lot of Grand Theft Auto. I think I know how to handle a gat.", "Penny: Wow. You are cute when you get all gangsta. (Kisses him. Leonard accidentally shoots himself in the foot.)", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Leonard: So, I\u2019ve got a gunshot wound. That\u2019s pretty badass.", "Penny: No, you\u2019ve got a Reebok with a gunshot wound and an ouchie on your pinkie toe.", "Leonard: Hello? They gave me a Band-Aid. Hospitals do not issue Band-Aids unless it is medically necessary. That is the law.", "Penny: Well, thank you for a really cool evening.", "Leonard: Thank you for hiding my Star Wars socks at the emergency room. Is it a good time to evaluate the beta test and see where we stand?", "Penny: Things are looking good.", "Leonard: So, are we still taking things slow? Because a gunshot wound today, last week, I slammed my thumb in the kitchen drawer. We don\u2019t know how much time I have.", "Penny: Good night, you.", "Sheldon: Guten Tag, das YouTube. Ich bin ein Bavarian.", "Amy: Und ich bin eine pretzel!", "Sheldon: Und dis is Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun\u2026", "Amy: Mit\u2026", "Sheldon: Flags.", "Scene: An office suite.", "Receptionist: First door on the left.", "Raj: Thank you. (Enters a door marked \u201cThe Office of Siri\u201d Inside is a red-headed woman sitting at a huge console desk.) ", "Siri: Dave, I found six vacuum cleaner repair shops in your area. Four are fairly close to you. (To Raj) Hello, sexy. What can I help you with? If you\u2019d like to make love to me, just tell me. (Raj tries to speak) I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t understand.", "Raj (waking from a dream): No!"]}
