Now, give me a number.", "Leonard: Five.", "Sheldon: Uh-huh. And an irrational constant.", "Howard: E.", "Sheldon: And a funny Greek letter.", "Raj: Gamma.", "Sheldon: I said funny.", "Raj: Upsilon?", "Sheldon: Good one. And an electrical charge.", "Leonard: Positive.", "Sheldon: Ha. Perfect. Okay. Get this. Professor Jones told the symposium he had a new method for calculating the mass of a muon. Five times the limit of E to the upsilon as in a (laughs uncontrollably). Okay. No, no. I\u2019ll start over. Professor (laughs again)", "Howard: I haven\u2019t seen him laugh that hard since the day Leonard made that multiplication error.", "Sheldon: Oh, Oh, Lord, that multiplication error! He thought he carried the one. But he didn\u2019t.", "Leonard: It\u2019s not funny. That mistake got published.", "Sheldon: Stop! I\u2019m going to wet myself!", "Raj: Hey, guys, guys, President Siebert is headed this way.", "Howard: I wonder what he wants.", "Leonard: Doesn\u2019t look happy, so I\u2019m guessing he wants to talk to Sheldon.", "Seibert: Dr. Cooper?", "Leonard: Told ya.", "Sheldon: Oh, President Siebert, I assume you\u2019d like to respond to one of the suggestions I put in the box by your office.", "Seibert: No, and stop installing suggestion boxes everywhere.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t like written suggestions. You don\u2019t like when I give them to you while we\u2019re urinating in the men\u2019s room. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say that you\u2019re one of those stubborn people who are not open to suggestions.", "Seibert: Dr. Cooper, the physics department chair tells me you\u2019re refusing to take your vacation.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t need a vacation.", "Seibert: You\u2019re obligated to take one. And I\u2019d also like you to know the most-often received suggestion in my suggestion box you installed without asking me is can Dr. Cooper take a vacation? Okay, settled, then. I\u2019ll see you all on Monday, except for you.", "Sheldon: But if I don\u2019t come into work, what am I supposed to do with myself?", "Seibert: Read, rest, travel. I hear Afghanistan is nice this time of year.", "Sheldon: Sarcasm?", "Howard: No. You should go.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car. Leonard is singing enthusiastically.", "Leonard: That tonight\u2019s gonna be a good night, and tonight\u2019s gonna be a good night, and tonight\u2019s gonna be a good, good night! Tonight\u2019s the night, uh, uh, let\u2019s live it up, uh, I got my money, let\u2019s spend it up\u2026", "Sheldon (appearing in the back seat): Good Lord! Would you stop that caterwauling!", "Leonard: What the hell are you doing?", "Sheldon: Bleeding from my ears.", "Leonard: What are you doing hiding back there?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sneaking into work. Now, if the guard at the university asks what\u2019s under the blanket, you tell him it\u2019s some lobster traps.", "Leonard: Lobster traps?", "Sheldon: Yes. That\u2019s how Velma and Scooby smuggled Shaggy into the old lighthouse.", "Leonard: What are you going to do when you get to the university? People are going to recognize you.", "Sheldon: Will they, Leonard? (Puts on cap and long-hair wig)", "Leonard: Fine. Just get back under your blanket, and I\u2019ll drive you there.", "Sheldon: And no more singing.", "Leonard: Fine.", "Sheldon: I have GPS on my phone. I know you turned around.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: I\u2019m so glad you talked Howard out of having your wedding invitations in Klingon.", "Bernadette: Turn it over. I\u2019m hoping my relatives think it\u2019s Hebrew.", "Amy: This is really happening. I\u2019m gonna be a maid of honour. I\u2019m gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle and, finally, I will have my special day.", "Bernadette: You mean my special day?", "Amy: They\u2019re gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody\u2019s head.", "Bernadette: If I ever actually ever get married.", "Penny: Why wouldn\u2019t you?", "Bernadette: My dad. Because I make a lot more money than Howie, he\u2019s putting a lot of pressure on me to get a pre-nup.", "Penny: Ouch.", "Bernadette: Yeah. Howie\u2019s gonna freak out.", "Amy: Parental pressure can be daunting. I remember the battle with my mother about shaving my legs. Last year, I finally gave in and let her do it.", "Bernadette: I just don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna break it to him.", "Penny: You know, I\u2019m a big believer in breaking bad news to a guy when you\u2019re in bed with him. That\u2019s how I told my high school boyfriend I slept with his brother. That\u2019s how I told his brother the same thing.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to manipulate him with sex.", "Penny: Oh, sweetie, that\u2019s what sex is for.", "Amy: You know, the connection between marriage and money is nothing new. In fact, the term wed referred to the money and livestock that the groom paid the bride\u2019s father. For example, you\u2019re adorable, intelligent and a good earner. I could conservatively see you going for at least two oxen and a goose. (To Penny) You would fetch a unicorn.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Sheldon, there are a million great vacations you could take. What about Hawaii?", "Sheldon: Hawaii is a former leper colony on top of an active volcano where the disappointing ending to Lost was filmed. Mahalo for nothing, Hawaii.", "Howard: How about Florida? They\u2019ve got Cape Canaveral, they\u2019ve got Disney, they\u2019ve got my Aunt Ida and the world\u2019s largest collection of diabetic candy. Plus, if you get sweaty enough, her plastic-covered furniture is like a flume ride.", "Sheldon: My family took a trip to Florida when I was a child. A seagull stole a hot dog from me on the beach. I got the message.", "Raj: You know, if I had a week off, I\u2019d go back to the Two Bunch Palms Resort and Spa in the desert. I tell you, an hour on the massage table with Trevor, and you\u2019ll feel like you were born without bones.", "Howard: I don\u2019t think I could ever let a guy give me a massage.", "Raj: Really? What was I doing to your neck last night while you were playing X-Box?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s like I\u2019m living in a dictatorship. You must take a vacation, you must have fun, you must enjoy life.", "Howard: I don\u2019t think you have a good handle on dictatorships.", "Leonard: Sheldon, everybody takes vacations.", "Sheldon: One time they tried to make Richard Feynman take a vacation, but he chose instead to expand his mind and learn something new. He went to work in his friend\u2019s biology lab. Richard Feynman was a famous American physicist, part of the Manhattan Project.", "Howard: Everyone in the world of science knows who Richard Feynman was.", "Sheldon: Now you do, too. Oh! I have a brilliant idea. Amy\u2019s a biologist. I\u2019ll go work in her lab.", "Howard: Isn\u2019t that just Feynman\u2019s idea?", "Sheldon: Ten seconds ago, you never heard of him. Now you\u2019re an expert.", "Scene: The hallway.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hey, you.", "Leonard: Is that your laundry? You only have, like, six things in there.", "Penny: Yeah, I didn\u2019t have any quarters, so I\u2019ve been sneaking stuff into other people\u2019s loads all day. Hey, if I tell you something, will you promise not to tell anybody?", "Leonard: It doesn\u2019t matter what I say, you\u2019re gonna tell me anyway.", "Penny: What? That is not true. Bernadette wants a pre-nup.", "Leonard: Wow. That\u2019s rough.", "Penny: So you\u2019re saying if I became a famous movie star, we got married, you wouldn\u2019t sign a pre-nup?", "Leonard: Absolutely not. If I\u2019m gonna be stuck at home with the kids while you\u2019re on location cheating on me with Ryan Gosling, then Leonard gots to get paid. So, you think about us getting married?", "Penny: I think about a lot of things. I think about us getting married, I think about us breaking up. Once in a while, I think about how I didn\u2019t leave a note on that Mercedes I dinged in the parking lot last month, but then I have a glass of wine and it passes.", "Leonard: Joke all you want, but you think about it.", "Penny: Well, tell you one thing, if I ever do get married, no Klingon invitations.", "Leonard: Good luck catching a man with that attitude.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Sheldon: Boy, oh, boy. This vacation is off to a wonderful start. The smell of formaldehyde, the whir of the centrifuge, the distant chatter of lab animals being dispatched for dissection. Mm, I can already feel my cares just melting away.", "Amy: I\u2019m excited to work with my boyfriend. It\u2019s gonna be romantic.", "Sheldon: Way to kill the mood.", "Amy: Come on, Sheldon. We can be like Marie Curie and her husband, Pierre, who spent their days working side by side, bathed in the glow of their love and the radium that ultimately killed her. Screw Beauty and the Beast, that\u2019s the love story Disney should tell.", "Sheldon: Okay, what do we start with? Maybe splicing some genes, clone a sheep, perhaps grow a human ear on a mouse\u2019s back? Ha-ha, I\u2019m a freak!", "Amy: Oh, I\u2019m gonna be doing some brain stem histology while you put yourself on the business end of a sponge and wash those beakers.", "Sheldon: Wash those bea\u2026 Oh, I get it, a little hazing for the new fella. Yeah, I\u2019d better keep and eye out for, what, shoe polish on the microscope, or mad cow disease in my grilled cheese sandwich?", "Amy: No, I just need those beakers washed. Hippity-hop, quick like a bunny.", "Sheldon: What? Excuse me, you have Dr. Sheldon Cooper in your lab. You\u2019re gonna make him do the dishes? That\u2019s like asking the Incredible Hulk to open a pickle jar.", "Amy: Sheldon, you\u2019ve never worked in a lab like this before. You have no experience in the field of biology.", "Sheldon: I have plenty of experience in biology. I bought a Tamagotchi in 1998. And it\u2019s still alive. Let\u2019s do this.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Leonard: Where\u2019s Howard?", "Raj: No hi, Raj? No how are you, Raj? Just straight to where\u2019s the other white guy?", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry. So, listen, I heard something about him. Can you keep it between us?", "Raj: Ooh, gossip. When I first got here, I thought you Americans really gossiped around the water cooler. So I hung out there for, like, a month, but the only gossip I ever heard was about some creepy guy hanging out by the water cooler.", "Leonard: Bernadette wants to get a pre-nup.", "Raj: Oh, that\u2019s a shame, he\u2019s gonna be devastated.", "Leonard: I never know what to do in these situations. Should I give him a heads-up?", "Raj: Hmm. I\u2019m gonna give you the same advice I yell at the TV when the Bachelor\u2019s handing out roses. Follow your heart.", "Howard: Check it out. Look at the size of that Rice Krispie Treat. Same price.", "Leonard: Hey, Howard, I need to tell you something.", "Howard: I know, it\u2019s not on my wedding diet. I don\u2019t care.", "Leonard: Uh, listen, I heard that Bernadette\u2019s thinking about asking you for a pre-nup.", "Howard: A pre-nup? Wow.", "Leonard: What are you gonna do?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know.", "Raj: Follow your heart.", "Howard: You know what, it\u2019s not a big deal. She makes more money than me. She wants to protect her financial interests. It\u2019s completely reasonable.", "Leonard; Good. That\u2019s a healthy attitude.", "Howard: Yeah, actually, it\u2019s good for both of us. I have assets to protect, too.", "Raj: Like what?", "Howard: I\u2019ve got some rare comic books. The Vespa\u2019s almost paid off. And Ma and I have a primo double cemetery plot at Mt. Sinai right near the guy who played Mr. Roper on Three\u2019s Company.", "Raj: Mr. Roper\u2019s dead? You can\u2019t just spring that on a guy.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Sheldon: Here you go. This is now the only lab with glassware washed by a man with two doctorates and a restraining order signed by Carl Sagan.", "Amy: Soap spots. Wash \u2019em again.", "Sheldon: Y-you\u2019re being ridiculous. Those are perfectly clean.", "Amy: Sheldon, this beaker used to contain cerebral spinal fluid from an elephant that died of syphilis. If it\u2019s, in fact, perfectly clean, drink from it.", "Sheldon: Biologists are mean.", "Later.", "Amy: All right, perhaps this task will be a little bit more up your alley. I need you to count the bacteria spores on these petri dishes.", "Sheldon: There was something wrong with that detergent. That was way too bubbly.", "Amy: I\u2019m sure it was.", "Sheldon: I intend to write that soap company a strongly worded letter.", "Amy: Yeah, good for you. Now, start counting.", "Sheldon: You know what this place needs? A suggestion box.", "Later.", "Sheldon: 366\u2026 367\u2026", "Amy: How\u2019s it going?", "Sheldon: How\u2019s counting going? When I was in kindergarten, I recited pi to a thousand places for the school talent show. I think I got this.", "Amy: Great.", "Sheldon: Aw, nuts! One\u2026", "Later.", "Sheldon: This is preposterous. I think you\u2019re giving me these tasks because you\u2019re afraid if you give me anything meaningful to do, I\u2019ll show you up.", "Amy: Really? Is that what you think?", "Sheldon: Yes, that\u2019s what I think. And I\u2019m super smart, so it\u2019s probably true.", "Amy: Hey, I\u2019ve been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You\u2019ve been here for three hours, and you\u2019ve spent one of them in the bathroom.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet.", "Amy: Sheldon, I\u2019ve given you the simplest things to do, and you haven\u2019t done one of them right.", "Sheldon: Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019m not being challenged. It\u2019s the same reason Einstein failed math.", "Amy: Maybe the math was too bubbly for him.", "Sheldon: You think you\u2019re doing science by cutting up that brain? They could do the same thing at any Quiznos. And they\u2019d offer to toast it for me, too.", "Amy: Okay, smart guy. I\u2019m about to remove the locus coeruleus, which is incredibly delicate work. Have at it.", "Sheldon: All right. I\u2019m no stranger to a little gray matter. Locus coeruleus. Locus coeruleus.", "Amy: You\u2019re getting warmer, it is, indeed, in the brain. Hope your hands are steady. It\u2019s the width of a single hair. But this is just biology, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s no problem for a genius like you.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not. I\u2019ll have you know, in the field of physics, we work with particles so small, they make fat jokes about the locus coeruleus, i.e., when your locus coeruleus sits around the house, it sits around the house.", "Amy: Oh, are we nervous, Dr. Cooper?", "Sheldon: No. What you see is a man trembling with confidence. Does a locus coeruleus normally bleed that much?", "Amy: No. But your thumb does.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear. (Faints)", "Amy: Yeah, you\u2019re a biologist.", "Scene: The bar at the Cheesecake Factory.", "Howard: What are you doing here?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m on vacation. Social convention dictates that I let my hair down at a local watering hole. Social convention is stupid.", "Howard: What happened to your thumb?", "Sheldon: You know, I have ten fingers and ten toes. If I tell you a story about each one of them, we\u2019ll be here all day, let\u2019s just move on.", "Barman: What can I get you?", "Sheldon: Ah, seeing as I\u2019m on vacation, a pina colada seems appropriate. Extra pineapple slices, extra whipped cream, extra cherries, extra umbrellas, and, uh, hold the rum. Don\u2019t let me have too many of those.", "Penny: Hey, what are you guys doing here?", "Howard: We\u2019re grown men, we drink at bars.", "Penny: No and no. Everything okay with you and Bernadette?", "Howard: Oh, yeah, sure.", "Penny: You and Amy? Good?", "Sheldon: Oh, better than good.", "Penny: You know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens.", "Howard: I\u2019m not signing a pre-nup.", "Penny: All right, Howard Wolowitz, listen up. You sign anything she puts in front of you, because you are the luckiest man alive. If you let her go, there is no way you can find anyone else. Speaking on behalf of all women, it is not gonna happen, we had a meeting. And you, a grown man fainting at the sight of a little blood.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, this is a fairly substantial wound. (Removes plaster. Faints again)", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?", "Amy: What do you want?", "Sheldon: I was kind of hoping I could continue vacationing in your laboratory. After all, I did book the whole week.", "Amy: Do you honestly think you can just waltz back in here after the way you behaved yesterday?", "Sheldon: I was not myself. I had lost a lot of thumb blood.", "Amy: That\u2019s not an apology.", "Sheldon: That is your opinion.", "Amy: I want a real apology.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry that you weren\u2019t able to\u2026", "Amy: No.", "Sheldon: That my genius\u2026", "Amy: No.", "Sheldon: That the soap was\u2026", "Amy: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Fine. Sorry.", "Amy: You\u2019re forgiven. Now, if you want to stay, get started on those beakers. They\u2019re still dirty from yesterday.", "Sheldon: Next year I\u2019m going to Epcot.", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s car.", "Bernadette: Are you mad at me?", "Howard: No. I\u2019m not mad at you. I just wish you would have come to me, so I didn\u2019t have to hear it through the nerd-vine.", "Bernadette: So, what are we gonna do?", "Howard: You really want me to sign a pre-nup?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know. My dad\u2019s pretty insistent on it, though.", "Howard: Why don\u2019t I talk to your dad, man-to-man?", "Bernadette: Really? Oh, that\u2019d be so great.", "Howard: Done.", "Bernadette: I should probably give you a heads-up about a couple of things. Even though he\u2019s retired from the police force, he still carries his gun. But don\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t shoot it. It\u2019s more of a fashion statement.", "Howard: Okay.", "Bernadette: And just to be safe, when you talk to him, don\u2019t bring up Jimmy Carter, gardeners, foreign people, homosexuals, Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control, organic food, the designated hitter rule, recycling or the fact that you\u2019re Jewish.", "Howard: Got it, got it. Will you e-mail me that list?", "Bernadette: So the thing to watch for, if he\u2019s shouting at you, you\u2019re okay, but if he starts to get real quiet, leave as quickly as you can without making eye contact. Not in a straight line, throw some zigs and zigs in there.", "Howard: You know, this isn\u2019t that pressing. Why don\u2019t I talk to him about it in May.", "Bernadette: In May you\u2019re gonna be on the International Space Station.", "Howard: They\u2019ve got a phone."]}
