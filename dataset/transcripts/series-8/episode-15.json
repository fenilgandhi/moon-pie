{"series": "8", "episode": "15", "transcript": ["Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?", "Amy: Sure.", "Sheldon: How many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?", "Amy: How many?", "Sheldon: Who cares? He stole the idea and doesn\u2019t deserve his own joke.", "Amy: Is that really true?", "Sheldon: Of course, that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s a good joke. It not only entertains, it informs.", "Barry: Hey, sowwy to intewupt.", "Sheldon: Uh, Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take to screw in a light bulb?", "Barry: Did you know Edison didn\u2019t actuawy invent the wight bulb?", "Sheldon: What do you want, Barry?", "Barry: Just wanted to dwop this off as a wittle thank you for Amy.", "Amy: What\u2019s this for?", "Barry: Your idea weawy hewped me out. My wight-cone quantization paper\u2019s onwine alweady. The wesponse has been amazing.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s fascinating. I can\u2019t wait to read it.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, me as well. Uh, please e-mail it to Sheldon at bazinga dot biz. Why dot biz? Because I just gave you the business. And also bazinga dot com was taken.", "Barry: Anyway, thanks again. Cooper, suck eggs.", "Sheldon: Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?", "Amy: Well, I\u2019d been thinking about a cellular automata approach to neuronal connectivity, and I thought it might have some interesting applications to string theory, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "Sheldon: Oh, really? When I was doing string theory and hit a dead end, why didn\u2019t you try to help me?", "Amy: I did. You said the only math biologists know is if you have three frogs and one hops away, that leaves two frogs.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s pretty funny, that does sound like me. But that doesn\u2019t mean that you should be standing on street corners handing out your math to whatever guy comes along.", "Amy: Sheldon, we\u2019re all scientists. I helped out a fellow colleague. You\u2019re being petty.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m being petty? You know Barry and I have a professional rivalry. You heard him, he told me to suck eggs. If we were friends, he would have suggested I suck something more pleasant. Why are you laughing? Did you learn something?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard (on phone): Okay, Ma. Say hi to Aunt Gladys. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.", "Bernadette: Your mom having fun in Florida?", "Howard: Mmm, she loves it. She finally found a place where everyone talks about how sweaty they are. Anyway, she wants us to go to the house and check in on Stuart because he might be lonely.", "Bernadette: She\u2019s just being nice.", "Howard: Well, I\u2019m her son, how come she doesn\u2019t send someone to check on me if I\u2019m lonely?", "Bernadette: Because you have a wife.", "Howard: Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.", "Bernadette: I know you don\u2019t like Stuart being in the house, but the store\u2019s about to reopen, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get back on his feet.", "Howard: That would be great. I\u2019d love for things between me and Mom to get back to normal.", "Bernadette: Well, normal\u2019s a strong word, but sure.", "Scene: The laundry room.", "Penny: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: You okay?", "Sheldon: If I was okay, I would\u2019ve said hello, and not the much more ominous hello.", "Penny: What\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m mad at Amy.", "Penny: Did she leave pit stains in your favourite crop top, too?", "Sheldon: No. She helped Barry Kripke make an advancement in string theory.", "Penny: Oh, that sounds like a good thing.", "Sheldon: Well, it would be, except that I left string theory because I decided it was a dead end. Yeah, and then she went behind my back to help someone else prove me wrong. My rival, no less. I\u2019m sorry you had to see that.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have a camera.", "Sheldon: Why would she do this to me?", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t upset you on purpose. Besides, aren\u2019t you the one who says there\u2019s nothing more important than the advancement of science?", "Sheldon: No, I said there\u2019s nothing more important than me advancing science.", "Penny: All right, well, if I\u2019m understanding this right, and all she did was help out another scientist, I\u2019m thinking you might have to let this one go.", "Sheldon: Ugh, let it go. I have heard that my whole life. Every time something upsets me somebody says, let it go, you know, like it\u2019s my fault, and it\u2019s not okay to feel the way I feel.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I mean, why don\u2019t you talk to her?", "Sheldon: Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits like talk to her and let it go? Gee, Penny, life\u2019s giving me lemons. What should I do?", "Penny: Well, you could shove them somewhere.", "Sheldon: Okay, now you\u2019re getting creative.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Stuart: Thanks again for your help.", "Leonard: No problem.", "Raj: Our pleasure.", "Leonard: The place really looks great.", "Raj: Yeah, you should have burned it down years ago.", "Stuart: I keep telling you I didn\u2019t burn it down.", "Leonard: We know, we know, because burning something down for the insurance money is a crime.", "Bernadette: Stuart, this place looks amazing.", "Stuart: Thanks.", "Howard: You really did a nice job.", "Stuart: And thank you for putting up with me staying at your mom\u2019s through all this. I couldn\u2019t have done it otherwise.", "Howard: I appreciate that, and I\u2019m glad you were able to\u2026 is that my mother\u2019s furniture?", "Stuart: Yeah, she said I could use it. Doesn\u2019t it look great?", "Howard: Not as great as it looks in the den where it belongs.", "Bernadette: Howie.", "Howard: Why don\u2019t you just clean out the whole room? Take the string art clown I made her in third grade and the ribbon I got in swim class for putting my face in the water.", "Stuart: What is your problem? She said it was okay.", "Howard: Well, I\u2019m her son, and I say it\u2019s not okay.", "Stuart: Some son, looks like you spent ten minutes on that clown art.", "Howard: Well, maybe I should\u2019ve gone to a fancy art school like you. Then I could run a failed comic shop and mooch off some guy\u2019s mother.", "Bernadette: Why don\u2019t we leave so you can cool off?", "Stuart: I think that\u2019s a good idea. Take him out of my store.", "Howard: Your store? My mother gave you the money to reopen. I\u2019m not going anywhere.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t we go get the food for the party.", "Stuart: Thank you.", "Raj: Smart, looks like we\u2019re being helpful.", "Leonard: Mmm, when really we\u2019re just exiting an uncomfortable situation.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Kripke, you know, of all the people, Barry Kripke. I\u2019m so\u2026 Are you folding that like a crazy person to get me to do it for you?", "Penny: No.", "Sheldon: Oh, give me that. Just out of curiosity, if I were to let something go, how would I do that?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know, just think about something else.", "Sheldon: Can I think about the spiny anteater?", "Penny: Sure.", "Sheldon: The spiny anteater never went behind my back and worked with Barry Kripke. That didn\u2019t help at all.", "Penny: You know, some people try visualization.", "Sheldon: How does that work?", "Penny: Okay, imagine your problems are a pen.", "Sheldon: Okay.", "Penny: Now imagine you\u2019re holding that pen.", "Sheldon: Okay.", "Penny: Now open your hand and let it go.", "Sheldon: But I just got this pen. It\u2019s got my initials on it and everything. Look.", "Penny: Sheldon, this isn\u2019t that hard.", "Sheldon: I may have a better way that you can teach me.", "Penny: How?", "Sheldon: What if I told you that over the past few months Amy has secretly been giving you little puzzles to test your intelligence against chimpanzees in her lab?", "Penny: What? She didn\u2019t give me any puzzles.", "Sheldon: Are you sure?", "Amy (in flashback): Boy, I just can\u2019t seem to get these scissors back together. Can you do it?", "Amy (in flashback): Darn it. There\u2019s something in my eye, and I need to sort these coins by size. Can you help?", "Amy (in flashback): Penny? I really want to eat this banana, but it\u2019s stuck inside this bamboo puzzle box.", "Penny: Son of a bitch.", "Sheldon: Okay, that\u2019s great. Now, let it go.", "Penny: I can\u2019t believe you were testing me against a chimp.", "Sheldon: Well, excuse me, Amy was testing you. I was rooting for you. Good job on that banana box, by the way.", "Penny: Why would she even do this?", "Sheldon: She\u2019s been conducting an experiment on apes where they\u2019re given various puzzles to solve. I was surprised at the complexity of the puzzles and thought some humans wouldn\u2019t be able to solve them. That\u2019s when Amy said, want to make this interesting?", "Penny: Make this interesting? You bet money on me?", "Sheldon: No, no. We designed an experiment involving you. See? Now, isn\u2019t that interesting?", "Penny: It\u2019s not interesting. It\u2019s incredibly insulting.", "Sheldon: Okay, maybe this will help. Imagine you\u2019re holding a pen. Before you go too far, not a special pen with your initials engraved on it, that\u2019ll make the next part really hard.", "Penny: Oh, my, that\u2019s it. Get out.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re mad at me. You should be mad at Amy. Like I was this afternoon. Hey, look at that, I let it go.", "Penny: Get out.", "Sheldon: Penny?", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: I think I left my pen in there.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Bernadette: I understand why you\u2019re upset, but he worked really hard to get the store ready. And it\u2019s just furniture.", "Howard: It\u2019s my mom\u2019s furniture. It belongs in the house I grew up in, next to that pile of TV Guides and in plain view of what, for a ten-year-old, was a quality piece of string art.", "Bernadette: Howie, if the store succeeds, Stuart has a source of income, and he can move out of your mother\u2019s house. Seems like some old furniture is a reasonable price to pay for that.", "Howard: That is a good point. But I didn\u2019t marry you for good points. I married you to blindly support me no matter how ridiculous I\u2019m being.", "Bernadette: This is why I had to rewrite our wedding vows.", "Scene: A deli.", "Leonard: Hi, we\u2019re here to pick up an order for Comic Center.", "Waitress: Sure, let me go check on that.", "Raj: Dude, I, I think that\u2019s Nathan Fillion.", "Leonard: Oh yeah, look at that.", "Raj: And he\u2019s picking the tomatoes out of his salad just like I do. I always did feel a connection with him. Oh, I have got an idea.", "Leonard: We\u2019re not selling his tomatoes on eBay.", "Raj: No, if we got Captain Reynolds from Firefly to do a signing at Stuart\u2019s store, that would be amazing.", "Leonard: That would be great.", "Raj: So should we go talk to him?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. I mean, if he\u2019s not nice, it\u2019s gonna make it hard for me to watch him in anything again.", "Raj: What? The, the guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk. We still watch Game of Thrones.", "Leonard: He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.", "Raj: I was distracted. It\u2019s weird seeing a member of the Night\u2019s Watch with a kayak strapped to his car. Come on. Hi, excuse me, s, sorry, I, I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but we\u2019re just really big fans of Firefly. And Dr. Horrible.", "Nathan Fillion: Oh, uh, I think you made a mistake. I\u2019m not an actor.", "Raj: Don\u2019t say that. I mean, you\u2019re not Dame Judi Dench, but you\u2019re pretty great.", "Nathan Fillion: Oh, yeah, I get it, you think I\u2019m Nathan Fillion, but I\u2019m not. So if you don\u2019t mind, I would just love to eat my lunch.", "Leonard: Come on. Sorry to bother you.", "Raj: Don\u2019t know why he\u2019s so grumpy. I got mistaken for that guy in Life of Pi once, and I\u2019m still floating.", "Scene: The hallway.", "Amy: Sheldon, it\u2019s me.", "Penny: Oh, hey. Did you see that? I, I figured out how to open the door all by myself. Maybe I\u2019ll fling some faeces around my cage to celebrate.", "Amy: What are you talking about?", "Penny: I know you\u2019ve been giving me secret puzzle tests.", "Amy: Sheldon, open the door.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t. I\u2019m naked.", "Amy: I just saw you.", "Sheldon: Hang on.", "Penny: Open the door now.", "Amy: Oh, hey.", "Penny: Pull up your pants.", "Amy: It\u2019s not a big deal. I run tests like this on undergrads all the time. If you fill out some paperwork at the university, I can get you five dollars.", "Penny: I don\u2019t want five dollars. I want my dignity.", "Amy: So what are we talking, like, ten bucks?", "Scene: The deli.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Raj: Thanks.", "Leonard: Sorry again.", "Nathan Fillion: No problem.", "Raj: Are you sure you\u2019re not him? Uh, you can tell us. We\u2019re scientists, not crazy fanboys.", "Nathan Fillion: All right, fine. I\u2019m him.", "Raj: And you\u2019re eating alone at a deli. I don\u2019t buy it, you\u2019re not him.", "Nathan Fillion: I just wanted to eat my lunch in peace. But I really am him. And thank you very much for being a fan. If you want, uh, let\u2019s take a picture.", "Leonard: That would be great.", "Raj: Great.", "Leonard: Yeah, thank you.", "Nathan Fillion: You bet.", "Raj: Wait, hang on. If you\u2019re really Nathan Fillion, what\u2019s the line from Firefly about your bonnet?", "Nathan Fillion: I swear by my pretty floral bonnet, I will end you.", "Leonard: That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the line.", "Raj: Although, I knew the line, doesn\u2019t make me Nathan Fillion.", "Nathan Fillion: Do you want the picture or not?", "Raj: I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.", "Nathan: How about a picture with a guy who looks like Nathan Fillion but a little more annoyed than Nathan Fillion usually is?", "Leonard: What do you think?", "Raj: Ah, it\u2019s good enough for Facebook.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Leonard: I can\u2019t believe they did that.", "Penny: I know, it\u2019s so insulting. At one point, they had me figure out how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.", "Leonard: Wait, Sheldon gave me a banana in a box. He was testing me, too.", "Penny: Unbelievable.", "Leonard: And how could a chimp even solve that? That was impossible.", "Penny: Really? You couldn\u2019t get it out?", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: Wow, the store looks great.", "Leonard: So you guys were testing us both? What is the matter with you?", "Penny: Eh, what\u2019s the matter with them is they think they\u2019re so smart they don\u2019t care if they hurt other people\u2019s feelings.", "Amy: That\u2019s not true.", "Sheldon: That sounds like us. I still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re upset. You solved every puzzle faster than all of the chimps.", "Amy: Well, except Barnabas, but he was on Adderall.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s making me crazy.", "Bernadette: Can you please just let it go?", "Sheldon: Oh, I can help you with that. Imagine you\u2019re holding an ordinary pen. While your favourite pen is safe and secure in your pocket.", "Howard: Hold that thought. (On phone) Hello?", "Amy: How can I make this up to you?", "Penny: The answer\u2019s in this puzzle box. Let\u2019s see if you can open it.", "Stuart: You could have at least warned him about the furniture.", "Raj: That\u2019s what I said when we moved it.", "Bernadette: You helped him?", "Raj: No, Stuart picked out those throw pillows all on his own.", "Leonard: Hey, you okay?", "Howard: No.", "Leonard: What\u2019s wrong?", "Howard: My mom died.", "Bernadette: What?", "Howard: Uh, that was my aunt. Ma took a nap. She never woke up.", "Bernadette: Oh, my God, Howie.", "Leonard: I\u2019m so sorry.", "Raj: What can we do?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know.", "Sheldon: May I say something?", "Leonard: Not right now, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: But I think it would be comforting.", "Leonard: Buddy.", "Howard: No, it\u2019s okay. What?", "Sheldon: When I lost my own father, I didn\u2019t have any friends to help me through it. You do.", "Penny: I really thought he was gonna say let it go.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj (on phone): Okay, thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe. Okay, bye. Well, they\u2019ve booked a flight. They\u2019re heading to the airport now.", "Penny: How\u2019s Howard holding up?", "Raj: He\u2019s hanging in there.", "Leonard: How are you doing, Stuart?", "Stuart: Still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. I mean, that woman took me in. If it wasn\u2019t for her, I, I would have been homeless.", "Amy: One of us would have taken you in.", "Stuart: Yeah, I don\u2019t recall any offers. But, you know what, uh, I, I\u2019m glad it worked out the way it did because I got to know this wonderful person.", "Raj: Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special. When I first moved to America, Howard was my only friend and she made me feel so welcome in her home. Which says a lot, because, those first few years, she thought I was the gardener.", "Penny: Whenever I saw her, she\u2019d say I was too skinny and try and feed me.", "Amy: She did that to me, too.", "Penny: Don\u2019t take this away from me.", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t care for her yelling. But now that I\u2019m not going to hear it again, I\u2019m sad.", "Leonard: If you want, I can yell at you later.", "Sheldon: It won\u2019t be as good.", "Leonard: Let\u2019s have a toast. To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother to all of us. We\u2019ll miss you."]}
