{"series": "8", "episode": "19", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. ", "Sheldon: Leonard, I\u2019ve been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.", "Leonard: Oh, I like to laugh. But say it anyway.", "Sheldon: Okay, um, what do you say to a graduate of the UC Berkeley physics department? I\u2019ll have fries with that. Because his education hasn\u2019t prepared him for a career in the sciences.", "Penny: You know, when they chase you out of there, you only have to run faster than Sheldon.", "Amy: Are you all set for your trip?", "Sheldon: Yeah, I think so. I just restocked the old PRK.", "Penny: PRK?", "Leonard: Public restroom kit. Everything a boy needs for making pee pee in new and strange places.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t see what\u2019s crazy about bringing a backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.", "Leonard: Keep going.", "Sheldon: And rubber gloves, uh, air freshener. Um, noise-cancelling headphones. Oh, danger whistle. Um, pepper spray. Ooh, a multi-language occupied sign. Uh, let\u2019s see, we have seat protectors, uh, booties for my shoes, a clothespin for my nose. Oh, and a mirror on a stick, so I can make sure the person in the stall next to me isn\u2019t some kind of weirdo.", "Penny: You still worried some Berkeley girl is gonna steal him away?", "Amy: Yes, who do you think gave him the danger whistle?", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: Would you like to play a physics car game I invented called I Can\u2019t Spy? It\u2019s all the nail-biting tension of I Spy but the added fun of subatomic particles and waves outside the visible spectrum.", "Leonard: If it\u2019s half as much fun as One Times Ten to the Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I\u2019m in.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll begin. Uh, I can\u2019t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.", "Leonard: That soy Frappuccino I had.", "Sheldon: Will you please play the game? I can\u2019t spy with my little eye something passing right through us.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, um, if 65 billion solar neutrinos pass through a square centimetre every second, given the surface area of this car is about 60,000 square centimetres, that means 3.9 times ten to the 15th solar neutrinos?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t want to play anymore.", "Leonard: We haven\u2019t been on a road trip in a while. This is fun.", "Sheldon: We get it, you won the game. Stop bragging.", "Leonard: No, listen, we wrote a paper together. Now we get to go to a university and talk about it? That\u2019s pretty cool.", "Sheldon: I suppose it is. In fact, if you\u2019d like to celebrate with a little music, I\u2019d be okay with that.", "Leonard: What? This road trip just got crazy.", "Sheldon: Play that funky music, white boy.", "Leonard: I\u2019m surprised you know that reference.", "Sheldon: What reference?", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Bernadette: So, I put stickers on everything we\u2019re gonna sell. We just need help taking it all out to the driveway.", "Amy: Can I be in charge of pricing? I\u2019ve been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel?", "Howard: All right, Amy\u2019s in charge of pricing and being 75.", "Raj: Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?", "Penny: Sure. Oh, we had one of these growing up. I used to play all the time.", "Raj: Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.", "Penny: Oh, I meant beer pong.", "Amy: I had a table, too, but I didn\u2019t have any friends, so all I did was serve.", "Bernadette: You know, you can leave one side up and play against it.", "Amy: And if I had a friend, they might have told me that.", "Howard: Excuse me. Why is there a sticker on this? It\u2019s my TARDIS from Doctor Who. I was planning on moving it in the house.", "Bernadette: I think you just answered your own question.", "Howard: Come on, one day, this may double in value and be worth half what I paid for it.", "Bernadette: Sweetie, we have a lot to do. We don\u2019t need to decide this right now.", "Howard: Well, I guess as long as you\u2019re keeping an open mind.", "Bernadette: Of course.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car. \u201cPlay that funky music, white boy\u201d is playing on the stereo.", "Sheldon: So they\u2019re requesting that the white boy play the funky music, yes?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: And this music we\u2019re listening to right now is funky as well?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Sheldon: Let me ask you this. Do you think this song is the music the white boy ultimately plays?", "Leonard: It could be.", "Sheldon: So it\u2019s like the musical equivalent of Russell\u2019s Paradox, the question of whether the set of all sets that don\u2019t contain themselves as members contains itself?", "Leonard: Exactly.", "Sheldon: Well then I hate it. Music should just be fun.", "Leonard: Making great time. Gonna be there pretty early.", "Sheldon: Will our hotel room be ready?", "Leonard: I doubt it.", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t you worried that sitting in the lobby for a long period of time might attract the attention of the hotel detective?", "Leonard: If we do, we\u2019ll just tell him to hit the bricks, see?", "Sheldon: Seems a little confrontational, but all right. You know, we won\u2019t be very far from Skywalker Ranch.", "Leonard: Oh, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not like we can get in there.", "Sheldon: Why not?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think George Lucas put his headquarters in the middle of nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.", "Sheldon: Yoda\u2019s swamp was in the middle of nowhere. Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere. Hoth was in the middle of nowhere. That\u2019s code, Leonard. He wants us to drop in.", "Leonard: We do have time. I mean, we could drive by and just look at it.", "Sheldon: Yes. Oh, I\u2019m so excited. And I just can\u2019t hide it.", "Leonard: I\u2019m about to lose control, and I think I like it.", "Sheldon: What are you talking about?", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house. ", "Penny: So when do you guys think you\u2019re gonna move in?", "Howard: We\u2019re still figuring how much remodeling we want to do.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s tricky finding the right balance between tasteful modern and Jewish mother tchotchke crapfest.", "Amy: Have you made a decision about the TARDIS? I think I can sell it if we call it Big British Porta-Potty.", "Howard: We\u2019re not selling it, it\u2019s mine.", "Bernadette: You can\u2019t just decide. How about I arm-wrestle you?", "Howard: That\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.", "Raj: You could play Ping-Pong for it.", "Howard: I would do that.", "Bernadette: How is that fair? You grew up with a table.", "Howard: Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.", "Penny: Bernadette, for every episode of Doctor Who Leonard has made me sit through, I will play on your behalf and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey, where I hate that I know it belongs.", "Bernadette: Yes, Penny plays for me.", "Howard: That\u2019s not fair, she has upper body muscles.", "Raj: Dude, three-time Sanskriti School for Well-Born Boys badminton champion.", "Howard: That\u2019s right, okay, Raj can play for me.", "Amy: Ooh, you just chose champions. It\u2019s like we\u2019re re-enacting the ancient German practice of trial by combat.", "Penny: Yeah, it\u2019s also like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper in Game of Thrones.", "Bernadette: Leonard makes you watch that, too?", "Penny: No, no, I like that show. It\u2019s got dragons and people doing it.", "Howard: So it\u2019s settled. The fate of Doctor Who\u2019s TARDIS will be decided by a Game of Thrones inspired death-match on the battlefield of ThunderCats versus Transformers.", "Amy: If you still have that bra, I\u2019ll give you a nickel for it.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car. ", "Sheldon: There it is. It\u2019s just a gate. On a road.", "Leonard: Wasn\u2019t even that hard to find.", "Sheldon: This is so amazing.", "Leonard: I know. You want to get a picture?", "Sheldon: I want more than a picture. I want to go in.", "Leonard: Well, so do I, but they\u2019ll never let us.", "Sheldon: Is that the attitude that helped you get Penny?", "Leonard: No, but I don\u2019t have three years to make that gate feel sorry for me.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s a speaker box. Drive up, push the button, and let\u2019s see what happens.", "Leonard: Okay, yeah. What do we have to lose? I\u2019m a little nervous.", "Sheldon: Well, get over it. Confidence is key in these situations.", "Leonard: Right.", "Sheldon: You pushed it, are you out of your mind?", "Voice: May I help you?", "Leonard: Um, uh, uh, uh, we don\u2019t have an appointment, and, and we don\u2019t belong here, but we, we\u2019re, like, crazy-big fans. I mean uh, buh, buh, crazy for Star Wars crazy, not crazy like we have a backpack full of duct tape, although we do have a backpack that you really don\u2019t want to look in.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re blowing it. We want to meet George Lucas and become his friends and play with him.", "Voice: Hello? This speaker\u2019s not working, just pull up.", "Leonard: And that\u2019s how it\u2019s done.", "Scene: The same, further inside the ranch. ", "Sheldon: All right, we\u2019ve defeated the first challenge. Now we must steel ourselves to face the monster who defends the gate.", "Leonard: We\u2019re trying to get past a security guard, not rescue Zelda.", "Sheldon: I think what really needs to be rescued is your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time. So what\u2019s the plan?", "Leonard: Uh, I\u2019m just gonna be honest with the guy.", "Sheldon: Honesty will never get us in.", "Leonard: Well, what\u2019s your plan?", "Sheldon: All right, my plan is predicated on the assumption that they have a nurse\u2019s office and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.", "Security Guard: Who are you here to see?", "Leonard: Uh, I\u2019m just gonna tell you the truth.", "Sheldon: Oh, you are killing me.", "Leonard: We don\u2019t have an appointment. We, we\u2019re just fans of Mr. Lucas\u2019s work, and we thought we\u2019d take a shot and see if we could get in and look around.", "Security Guard: Sorry, guys, we get this a lot. Can\u2019t let you in.", "Sheldon: What if I told you that I was the voice of Yoda? A recording session I must attend.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t listen to him. We\u2019re actually physicists. We\u2019re giving a lecture at Berkeley later today. We just, we had some time to kill.", "Security Guard: Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys. I can\u2019t let you in, but I got some hats and T-shirts I can give you.", "Leonard: Thank you so much. See? Maybe honesty is the best\u2026 What are you doing?", "Sheldon: Shedding the yoke of my oppressors, you blind, sad little man.", "Security Guard: Don\u2019t move. Code A-A-23, A-A-23.", "Voice: Copy.", "Sheldon: I can see the ranch, Leonard. Oh, it\u2019s rustic, it\u2019s lovely. I\u2019d take a picture, but people are chasing me. I\u2019m gonna make it. I\u2019m gonna make it. They have Tasers, but they wouldn\u2019t dare use\u2026 Aaaaaaagh!", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house. ", "Howard: Come on, Raj. You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong. You are the menace of table tennis. Put her away, \u2019cause I don\u2019t have a third one. Yes. Woo.", "Amy: Rajesh eight, Penny four.", "Penny: Sorry, he\u2019s really good.", "Bernadette: Hey, Raj. if Howard can\u2019t keep the TARDIS, how great would it look at your place?", "Raj: What?", "Howard: Yeah, what?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t know much about Doctor Who, but if, um, you were to put this right outside your front door and open up the back, it would be like your entire apartment was the inside of the TARDIS, which is pretty cool \u2019cause on the show, the inside of the TARDIS is bigger than the outside. But then again, I don\u2019t know much about<i> Doctor Who.", "Howard: Don\u2019t listen to her. You and I go way back, we\u2019re like brothers.", "Raj: We are. We are. Oh, no. What a terrible serve. Sorry, brother.", "Amy: Eight-five.", "Howard: This is ridiculous. I want a new champion. Amy, were you serious about being able to serve?", "Amy: Uh, it, it\u2019s been a long time. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m probably pretty rusty.", "Penny: Wow.", "Howard: She\u2019s my champion.", "Bernadette: Well, if you can switch champions, so can I. I want Raj.", "Penny: Hey.", "Bernadette: Oh, come on, like you even care.", "Penny: I care. Oh, wait, no, I don\u2019t. Good luck, Raj.", "Howard: You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.", "Raj: So did I.", "Scene: An office in Skywalker Ranch. ", "Sheldon: Do you think they\u2019re gonna call the police?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019ll call Imperial Officers to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.", "Sheldon: Oh, I think that\u2019s below the pay grade of an Imperial Officer. Stormtroopers are really the ones who\u2026", "Leonard: Oh, shut up.", "Nerdy Guy: He\u2019s right. Uh, Stormtroopers actually combine both the function of infantry and military police.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Uh-huh, I\u2019m normally very nice, but you shut up, too.", "Sheldon: So, what are you in for?", "Nerdy Guy: Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas and say thank you. You know, growing up, the movies had such an impact on my life. I never really fit in anywhere. Till I discovered the worlds he created and finally found a place where I belong.", "Sheldon: But why are you here?", "Nerdy Guy: Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence, and they caught me in the sculpture gallery making out with a Chewbacca statue.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. Leonard, they have a sculpture gallery.", "Security Guard: All right, I talked to my supervisor, and we\u2019re gonna let you go with a warning. But if you ever come back, we will call the police and press charges.", "Leonard: We understand. Thank you so much.", "Nerdy Guy: Uh, what about me?", "Security Guard: No, you\u2019re not going anywhere, kissy face. Let\u2019s go. I have to take your picture to post at the guard gate.", "Sheldon: Uh, one question about that picture. Can it be with George Lucas? Ooh, grumpy you are.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Howard: Okay, this is the match that decides it all. First to 11 wins. Serve switches every five points. And just so you know, when this started, I was going to put the TARDIS in a discreet corner of the house, but I\u2019ve since turned mean, and now it\u2019s going right in the middle of the living room on a rotating platform with a sign that says suck it. Game on.", "Bernadette: Except, Raj is gonna win. Isn\u2019t that right, Raj?", "Raj: Uh, yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.", "Bernadette: Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.", "Raj: Okay, uh, I\u2019m gonna own you, bitch.", "Penny: Whoa.", "Bernadette: Hey.", "Amy: That\u2019s not nice.", "Raj: Let\u2019s just play.", "Howard: One-zero. Two. Three. Four. Five-nothing. Wait, did you play badminton or sad-minton?", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t listen to him, all she\u2019s got is a serve. Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.", "Raj: What, and that\u2019s not offensive? Where\u2019s the line?", "Penny: It\u2019s in your purse. Play.", "Bernadette: One-five. Two-five. Three-five. Four-five. Five-five.", "Howard: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-five.", "Bernadette: Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten-ten.", "Amy: Well, that was an exciting 40 seconds.", "Howard: It was, and now the serve is back to you, and the game is over.", "Bernadette: You know, Amy, I, uh, can\u2019t help but wonder how Sheldon would react if the TARDIS was at your place.", "Howard: Don\u2019t listen to her, just hit the ball.", "Amy: Keep talking.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Bernadette: If this doesn\u2019t get him into your bedroom, nothing will.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Sheldon: Are you still mad at me?", "Leonard: Yes, we missed our lecture, we were almost arrested, and you got me locked in a room with a man who forced his tongue down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.", "Sheldon: Boy, some people are just glass-half-empty.", "Leonard: The glass is empty, Sheldon. It\u2019s completely empty. If you gave that glass to a man who was dying of thirst, he would be dead, do you know why?", "Sheldon: Before I answer, was he a smoker? I think you\u2019re looking at this all wrong.", "Leonard: Fine, then tell me how I should be looking at it.", "Sheldon: Well, not only did we go to Skywalker Ranch, we got in. And no one we know can say that. And for all the times you find me irritating, today you got to watch someone shoot me with a Taser.", "Leonard: That part was pretty good.", "Sheldon: See?", "Leonard: You did flop around a lot.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll take your word for it. I was too busy trying not to defecate.", "Leonard: You know, when they were escorting us to the detaining room, I looked through a door, and I\u2019m pretty sure I saw a display case with the Ark of the Covenant.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s amazing.", "Leonard: I know.", "Sheldon: And I saw Jabba the Hutt riding by on a motorcycle. Although that was right after the Tasing, so who can say for sure?", "Leonard: I guess this could count as an adventure.", "Sheldon: It was. And even though we\u2019re not allowed back there, they can never take today away from us. Unlike my sense of smell, which hasn\u2019t returned since the Tasing. No, I got nothing.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s bedroom. ", "Sheldon: Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail, quick, we need to reset the time circuits. Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.", "Amy: Really should have thought this through."]}
