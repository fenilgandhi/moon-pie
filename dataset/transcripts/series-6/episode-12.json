{"series": "6", "episode": "12", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Well, I must say, Leonard, when I first heard your idea for Giant Jenga, I was sceptical.", "Leonard: I can\u2019t blame you. Tiny Twister was a complete bust.", "Sheldon: No, I was wrong. The looming threat of being crushed under a pile of lumber does add a certain spice. I\u2019ve never felt so alive. (Answers door) Oh, hello, Alex. Uh, let me go get you last night\u2019s recordings.", "Leonard: What recordings?", "Sheldon: Well, you remember when you told me I talk in my sleep? Well, it occurred to me that, like most things I say, it\u2019s probably pure gold. So I started recording it all, and now Alex gets to comb through eight hours of what I like to call Sheldon After Dark.", "Alex: Hey, Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey. Just playing a little Giant Jenga here.", "Alex: Oh, I know, I\u2019m the one who had to buy him the helmet. So, do you have any plans this weekend?", "Leonard: Well, most of Saturday\u2019s gonna be figuring out where to put this game when we\u2019re done. How about you?", "Alex: Oh, I\u2019m gonna go see Kip Thorne give a lecture on subatomic space-time.", "Leonard: Ooh. That\u2019s his take on John Wheeler\u2019s quantum foam. That should be great.", "Alex: Well, if you want, you can come with me.", "Leonard: Ah, I\u2019d love to, but I\u2019m supposed to hang out with Penny.", "Alex: Well, bring her.", "Leonard: Well, she\u2019s not really into that kind of stuff.", "Alex: Yeah, okay. Well, if you want to hear about the lecture, I can tell you all about it at work, or, you know, over dinner sometime.", "Leonard (jumping and knocking over the Jenga): What?", "Sheldon: Jenga, I win!", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: Oh, come on, that can\u2019t be true.", "Raj: I did the research. Tony the Tiger, Dig\u2019em the Frog, Cap\u2019n Crunch, Toucan Sam, Count Chocula, Trix the Rabbit, Snap, Crackle and Pop. Not one cereal mascot is a girl. It\u2019s a total breakfast sausage fest.", "Leonard: Are we done with this?", "Raj: Almost. Franken Berry, Boo Berry, Sugar Bear and the Honey Nut Cheerio bee, I believe his name is Buzz.", "Leonard: Terrific. Something weird happened and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.", "Howard: What\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: Sheldon\u2019s assistant asked me on a date last night.", "Raj: How could you do that to me? You know I\u2019ve been working it with Alex for weeks.", "Leonard: Working it? You can\u2019t even talk to her.", "Raj: I talk with my eyes.", "Howard: You look like my little cousin when he\u2019s dropping one in his diaper.", "Leonard: She knows I have a girlfriend. It\u2019s so weird.", "Raj: Oh, my God. You\u2019re loving this.", "Leonard: To my bones. I mean, I\u2019m not gonna do anything about it. I love Penny. It\u2019s just nice to have a young, attractive woman sniffing around the goods.", "Raj: I both hate you and want to be you. This is Ryan Gosling all over again.", "Sheldon: Ah, gentlemen, what is on the conversational menu this morning?", "Raj: Leonard stole my woman, and he knew full well I was only six to eight months away from making my move.", "Leonard: I didn\u2019t steal anyone.", "Raj: Your assistant is totally hitting on this jerk and he loves it.", "Sheldon: Well, that\u2019s not acceptable. I mean, I\u2019m her boss. She needs to be solely focused on my needs, not distracted by your pasty, androgynous brand of sexuality.", "Leonard: I\u2019m androgynous?", "Sheldon: Oh, please. Look at you with your pouty bee-stung lips.", "Leonard: What do you guys think I should do?", "Raj: I say you tell Alex your heart belongs to Penny, I provide her a shoulder to cry on, and then roughly half a year later I give it to her good.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: I want to thank you all for coming on such short notice. Uh, in the past, I\u2019ve reached out to each of you individually, but I believe my present situation requires the collective wisdom of the group, which as you can see from your commemorative T-shirts I have dubbed Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies.", "Penny: What is happening?", "Sheldon: I need your advice about a delicate workplace situation. Uh, to protect those involved, I\u2019ll be changing their names.", "Bernadette: Who\u2019s involved?", "Sheldon: Well, a short, bespectacled colleague of mine who lives in the shadow of his brilliant roommate. Let\u2019s call this colleague Ricardo Shilly-Shally.", "Penny: You\u2019re talking about Leonard.", "Sheldon: No, no, Shilly-Shally has red hair and, uh, he briefly served in the Mexican Navy. Anyway, despite the fact that he has a girlfriend, Shilly-Shally has been the recipient of inappropriate workplace flirtations from a young lady.", "Amy: It\u2019s your assistant Alex, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: No. No. No. This is Tondelaya della Ventimiglia.", "Penny: Wait, what the hell\u2019s going on with Leonard and Alex?", "Sheldon: No, uh, no, I\u2019m sorry. Who\u2019s talking about Leonard and Alex?", "Penny: Fine. Ricardo and Tondelaya.", "Sheldon: Okay, look, it\u2019s not really about Ricardo and Tondelaya. It is really about her boss, who doesn\u2019t quite know how to handle this situation and could use your advice, which is surprising because Dr. Einstein Von Brainstorm, he\u2019s usually pretty smart about these things.", "Penny: I\u2019m gonna kill her.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. Leonard would never cheat on you.", "Amy: She\u2019s right. But say the word, I got a lab full of cocaine-addicted monkeys with nothing to lose. One of them could end up in the backseat of her car. Or her shower.", "Sheldon: Ladies, ladies, please. We\u2019re not here to talk about Penny, okay? We\u2019re here to talk about me. Uh, I mean Einstein Von Brainstorm. Oh, darn it! All right, I guess the cat\u2019s out of the bag. Let me explain what\u2019s going on. Ricardo is really Leonard.", "Penny: We know what\u2019s going on, Sheldon!", "Sheldon: Well, what should I do?", "Bernadette: Well, Alex is your employee. If she\u2019s doing something that\u2019s making Leonard uncomfortable, you should talk to her.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, he\u2019s not uncomfortable at all. No, he\u2019s loving it. Yeah, he\u2019s strutting around like he\u2019s five-foot-six.", "Penny: What? He\u2019s loving it?", "Bernadette: Sheldon, you need to talk to Alex right away.", "Sheldon: Talk to her? That\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? With a cool name like Sheldon Cooper\u2019s Council of Ladies, I really expected more. Give me back the T-shirts.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Sheldon: Alex, check my schedule. What does my afternoon look like?", "Alex: I think it\u2019s pretty wide open. Oh, wait. Here\u2019s something at four o\u2019clock. Give Alex a talking to?", "Sheldon: Well, that snuck up on us, didn\u2019t it?", "Alex: Is there a problem?", "Sheldon: Let\u2019s not call it a problem. Let\u2019s call it an opportunity. To solve a serious problem.", "Alex: What did I do?", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t know? Oh, you poor dear. Your ovaries are squirting so much goofy juice into your brains you don\u2019t even know which way is up. You made an inappropriate sexual advance towards Dr. Hofstadter.", "Alex: What? I didn\u2019t make a sexual advance on anybody.", "Sheldon: Now, there\u2019s no need to get defensive. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to your plight. My father used to say that a woman is like an egg salad sandwich on a warm Texas day.", "Alex: What?", "Sheldon: Full of eggs and only appealing for a short time.", "Alex: This conversation is making me uncomfortable.", "Sheldon: Yeah, you and me both, sister. Now, please understand, I don\u2019t hold you responsible for your behaviour because, see, from an evolutionary standpoint, you\u2019re a slave to your desire to reproduce. But during the work day, when you feel possessed by amorous intent, may I suggest that you suppress it by leafing through this illustrated book of sexually transmitted diseases? Let\u2019s see here. Oh, yes. Check out this oozy doozy.", "Alex: I have to go.", "Sheldon: So does this fellow, but he can\u2019t without it burning like hot soup.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Leonard: Hey, pretty lady.", "Penny: Oh, you seem extra happy.", "Leonard: Uh, I guess I am.", "Penny: Any particular reason why?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, just having a good day. This morning Sheldon fell asleep on the way to work, so I got to listen to the radio. That was pretty crazy.", "Penny: Mm-hmm. Anything else?", "Leonard: Mm. I found this quiz online called Which Star Trek Character Are You? and it only took me four tries to get Captain Kirk.", "Penny: That\u2019s great.", "Leonard: Oh. It. Was.", "Penny: Hmm. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re having such a great day.", "Leonard: Yeah. And the one thing that could make it even better is an evening with my special girl.", "Penny: Oh, and who\u2019s that?", "Leonard: What do you mean?", "Penny: Oh, I just didn\u2019t know if you meant me or Alex.", "Leonard: Um, why would I mean Alex?", "Penny: Because I know she hit on you and I know you liked it.", "Leonard: What?", "Penny: Don\u2019t play dumb with me, Ricardo Shilly-Shally!", "Leonard: I\u2019m missing something. (Enters apartment. To Sheldon) Did you say something to Penny about Alex?", "Sheldon: Oh, yes. Yeah, and a fat lot of good it did me. All she did was get mad at you.", "Leonard: Why would you do that?", "Sheldon: I needed advice about a woman. I would have asked you, but if the last few years have proven anything, it\u2019s that you can\u2019t tell a uterus from a unicycle.", "Leonard: At least I know not to blab to a girl about somebody flirting with her boyfriend.", "Sheldon: Good to know. Yeah, a few more helpful hints like that, you may find yourself on the Council of Ladies. (Answering phone) Hello. I see. Uh, what time? Very well, then. Huh. That was the Human Resources Department at the university. Apparently, my assistant Alex has filed a complaint accusing me of inappropriate behaviour in the workplace.", "Leonard: Oh, my God, what did you do?", "Sheldon: Hmm, let me think. Nothing. I\u2019m a delight.", "Scene: The Human Resources Department.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department. (Knock, knock, knock) Human Resources Department.", "HR Woman: Come in.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "HR Woman: Ah, Dr. Cooper, have a seat.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "HR Woman: I called you in today because your assistant Alex Jensen has lodged a complaint against you.", "Sheldon: So I\u2019ve been told. But I can\u2019t understand what she has to complain about. I mean, she has a front-row seat as I make scientific history. There\u2019s string cheese in my mini-fridge, and that\u2019s for anyone. Yeah, and just yesterday I led her away from a life of sexual promiscuity by making her look at pictures of disease-ridden genitalia.", "HR Woman: Cancel my next appointment. This is gonna take a while. Dr. Cooper, you said things to your employee that you just cannot say in the workplace.", "Sheldon: Like what?", "HR Woman: Well, according to Ms. Jensen, you said that she was a slave to her biological urges and called her an egg salad sandwich. I don\u2019t even know what that means, but I\u2019m gonna go ahead and tell you you can\u2019t say it.", "Sheldon: Oh! I see the confusion here. No, no, Alex thought I was singling her out. No. I meant that all women are slaves to their biological urges, you know? Even you. You\u2019re a slave.", "HR Woman: I\u2019m a what?", "Sheldon: Well, y-you, I-I\u2019m just saying, you know, at a certain point in a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle\u2026", "HR Woman: Whuh-ah! Woah! You can\u2019t talk about that, either, Dr. Cooper. Your language is entirely inappropriate, and I\u2019m gonna advise that you shut your mouth right now.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t see why I\u2019m the one being persecuted here. Dr. Hofstadter, he was bragging about his sexual desirability to anyone who would listen. You know, and Howard Wolowitz, he spent two years using university resources building a six-breasted sex robot. Oh, and at the office Christmas party, I heard Rajesh Koothrappali refer to you several times as Brown Sugar.", "HR Woman (writing): Hofstadter\u2026 Wolowitz\u2026 and the last one was Rajesh Koothrappali?", "Sheldon: Yes. No, yeah, but in his defense, that wasn\u2019t racist. He\u2019s also brown.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny answers the door. Leonard is playing his cello outside.", "Leonard (singing): I\u2019m sorry Alex hit on me, hit on me, hit on me. I\u2019m sorry Alex hit on me, I\u2019d no idea I\u2019m cute.", "Penny: Oh, damn it, you are.", "Leonard: Please forgive me. I should have told you about Alex.", "Penny: I don\u2019t care about Alex. Fine, I care. Okay, I hate that bitch. But what really hurt is that you liked it so much. I mean, do I need to be worried?", "Leonard: Of course not. No. Why?", "Penny: Because, she is pretty and smart, and when you talk about work, she doesn\u2019t have to go home and look up words in the dictionary to understand what you said.", "Leonard: You do that?", "Penny: No.", "Leonard: Hang on. Are you feeling insecure? Because that\u2019s my thing, and if you take it away, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m bringing to this relationship.", "Penny: Yes, Leonard, I am insecure. Happy?", "Leonard: No, I\u2019m not happy.", "Penny: Why are you smiling?", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry. I just never think of you having feelings like that.", "Penny: Well, I do.", "Leonard: Why? Nothing is ever going to happen between me and Alex.", "Penny: Good.", "Leonard: Come here. Tell you a secret?", "Penny: What\u2019s that?", "Leonard: With all these women chasing me, I kind of do feel like Captain Kirk.", "Penny: Can I tell you a secret?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Penny: Keep talking about Captain Kirk, and we\u2019re all gonna stop.", "Leonard: Message received. Ah, excuse me. (Answering phone) Hello. This is Dr. Hofstadter. Okay. All right, thank you. That\u2019s weird. I\u2019m getting called in to Human Resources.", "Penny: What did you do?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Howard: Huh. I just got called in to Human Resources.", "Bernadette: Why?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: Huh. That is so strange. Human Resources wants to talk to me tomorrow. (To his dog) Could you stop licking your ass for two minutes? I have a problem here.", "Scene: Human Resources department.", "Howard: Do you really think you should be drinking right now?", "Raj: How else am I supposed to talk to the Human Resources lady?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Seek professional help?", "Raj: I did. The guy at the liquor store said this stuff tastes great in coffee.", "Howard: Wait, you got called in, too? What is going on?", "Leonard: Sheldon threw us all under the bus.", "Howard: Oh.", "Raj: I feel like I\u2019ve been called down to the principal\u2019s office. Although I wouldn\u2019t mind if Brown Sugar suspended me. From a sex swing. This may have been a mistake.", "Howard: Relax. Everything\u2019s gonna be fine. Before I met Bernadette I was in here every other day. Uh, little tip, turn off your I Like Big Butts ringtone before you go in.", "Raj: Well, this is all your fault.", "Leonard: How is this my fault?", "Raj: If you weren\u2019t screwing around with Sheldon\u2019s assistant, none of this would be happening.", "Leonard: I wasn\u2019t screwing around with anyone.", "Raj: Oh, of course not. She was just sniffing around your goods because she was hunting for truffles.", "HR Woman: Ah, Mr. Wolowitz, it\u2019s been a while.", "Howard: Hey, Janine. How are Tom and the kids?", "Janine: Fine. You must be Dr. Hofstadter.", "Leonard: Yes, but I think this is all a big misunderstanding.", "Raj: Yeah, yeah, me, too. I didn\u2019t do anything.", "Janine: Is that alcohol on your breath?", "Raj: Howard built a sex robot.", "Howard: That is not true. All I did was build a robot.", "Janine: Did it have six breasts?", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m a feminist, I don\u2019t notice things like how many breasts a robot has.", "Sheldon: Well, hello.", "Leonard: What are you doing here?", "Sheldon: Actually, I came to speak to Mrs. Davis.", "Janine: And I\u2019m a little busy right now.", "Sheldon: But I came to file a complaint. Somebody has made me feel uncomfortable in the workplace by using language of an inappropriate and sexual nature.", "Janine: And who was that?", "Sheldon: You, you dirty birdie. I-I thought about the things you said to me yesterday, and I realized I\u2019m deeply offended. Now, be a dear and get me one of those complaint forms.", "Janine: That\u2019s it. All of you, in my office now!", "Sheldon: And thanks to you, I know better than to ask if you\u2019re menstruating. And based on your behaviour, I don\u2019t have to.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Sheldon: It has been pointed out to me that some of the things I said to you could be construed as offensive, and I would like to offer you my sincerest apology.", "Alex: Thank you, Dr. Cooper.", "Sheldon: Yeah, additionally, you should know that the university has mandated that I take an online sexual harassment seminar so this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen in the future.", "Alex: Okay.", "Sheldon: Yeah. Now, unfortunately, uh, my time is much too valuable to waste on nonsense like this, so, um, I\u2019m gonna need you to take it for me. Oh, and, uh, you\u2019d better ace it, they\u2019re pretty mad.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: So, hey, I was thinking about that stuff with Alex.", "Leonard: Oh, would you stop worrying about that?", "Penny: I can\u2019t help it. But, look, I figured I could sit around and feel insecure, or I could do something about it. So I got a course catalogue at school and looked at some of the science classes.", "Leonard: That\u2019s great.", "Penny: No, it isn\u2019t, they are extremely boring. I mean, how do you not kill yourself, like, every day? Anyway, I decided I don\u2019t need to be a scientist, I could just look like one. So I bought these.", "Leonard: Glasses? I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna change\u2026 oh, my God, you look so smart and hot.", "Penny: I know, right? Watch this. Molecules.", "Leonard: Okay, come with me.", "Penny: Where are we going?", "Leonard: To my bedroom, so I can take everything off but those glasses. And maybe the boots."]}
