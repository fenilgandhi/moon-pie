{"series": "6", "episode": "08", "transcript": ["Scene: The cafeteria. Sheldon is drawing on a napkin.", "Raj: What are you drawing over there?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a hypothetical containment field for a Frisbee-sized wormhole that could serve as a portal to a parallel universe.", "Howard: Oh, you silly doodlebug.", "Leonard: You know, a lot of scientists believe that making contact with other life-forms would probably not end well for us.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard. You can block it with a Frisbee. Calm down. (Hands Howard the napkin)", "Howard: Do you expect me to build this?", "Sheldon: I expect you to wipe the pudding off your chin. Gentlemen.", "Howard: Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon always disappears every day at two forty-five?", "Leonard: Really?", "Raj: He probably just goes to the bathroom.", "Leonard: Actually, no, he goes to the bathroom at eight a.m. with optional follow-ups at one forty-five and seven ten high-fibre Fridays.", "Raj: It\u2019s sad that you know that.", "Leonard: Oh, that\u2019s just the tip of the sadness iceberg.", "Howard: I\u2019m looking at his public calendar. Two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing. Yesterday, two forty-five to three-oh-five, nothing, last week, nothing, last month, nothing. He never has anything booked during that time.", "Raj: Twenty minutes a day, completely unaccounted for.", "Howard: We should figure out where he goes.", "Raj: Ooh, this is exciting. Like one of my classic murder mystery dinner parties.", "Leonard: Right, the case of who murdered three Saturday nights of my life?", "Howard: Colonel Koothrapali in the kitchen with the olive spread.", "Raj: It was tapenade and you guys suck.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny is texting.", "Penny: So, how was work today?", "Leonard: Well, I spent most of the afternoon growing isotopically pure crystals for neutrino detection.", "Penny: That sounds like fun.", "Leonard: Yeah, it was.", "Penny: Oh, good, I guessed right.", "Leonard: Who you talking to?", "Penny: Oh, just this guy I met at school.", "Leonard: Oh, great. We\u2019re still dating, right?", "Penny: Relax. He\u2019s just a friend. We\u2019re doing an oral report together. He\u2019s really nice.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, what was that? I had a little stroke after oral.", "Penny: Would you stop? Look, he just moved here from London, okay? He doesn\u2019t really know anybody.", "Leonard: Oh, good, an English accent, the sexiest accent you can have.", "Penny: No. That\u2019s not true. There\u2019s French, there\u2019s Italian. No, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s the best.", "Leonard: Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?", "Penny: It didn\u2019t come up.", "Leonard: Well, maybe you should tell him.", "Penny: What am I supposed to say?", "Leonard: Say, can\u2019t talk right now, hanging with my boyfriend. England sucks, you suck, USA number one.", "Penny: Fine. Hanging with my boyfriend. Talk to you later. Happy?", "Leonard: Yes. Thank you.", "Penny: Mm-hmm. Hmm.", "Leonard: What did he say?", "Penny: Nothing.", "Leonard: What?", "Penny: Did your boyfriend make you type that?", "Leonard: I hate this guy.", "Penny: Don\u2019t be like that.", "Leonard: Come on, trust me, he\u2019s hitting on you.", "Penny: No, he\u2019s not. We\u2019re just friends. Look, is this gonna be a problem? Because he\u2019s supposed to come over tomorrow to work.", "Leonard: Really? Here?", "Penny: If it makes you uncomfortable, I\u2019ll switch partners, even though the thing\u2019s due next week and everyone already has a partner and I\u2019ll probably end up failing the class.", "Leonard: That\u2019d be great. Thank you.", "Scene: The corridor outside Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Howard: Two forty-four, Right on schedule. Hey, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Oh, hello.", "Howard: Raj and I are heading over to the genetics lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny. Want to come with us?", "Sheldon: No, thank you.", "Raj: Are you sure? They turn off the lights, and it\u2019s like a cute little laser show that poops all over the place.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m quite sure. Good day.", "Howard: Well, where are you going?", "Sheldon: Where are you going?", "Raj: We just told you.", "Sheldon: I just told you.", "Howard: No, you didn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Well, it\u2019s your word against mine; see you in court.", "Howard: Should we follow him?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m torn. I want to know where he\u2019s going, but now I kind of want to play with the bunny.", "Alex: Hi, guys.", "Howard: Hey, Alex, do you know where your boss just went?", "Alex: No.", "Howard: Don\u2019t you know his schedule?", "Alex: All I know is corduroy makes too much noise and I have to go find quieter pants.", "Howard: Come on.", "Raj: Boy, what I wouldn\u2019t give to get her out of those pants and into something a little more stylish.", "Scene: A corridor in the basement. Sheldon takes out a key, unlocks a door and enters.", "Howard: This is where he goes? What\u2019s in there?", "Raj: I think it\u2019s an old storage room.", "Howard: What could he be doing in there every day for twenty minutes?", "Raj: Well, he\u2019s not doing twenty-minute abs, because if he were, he would have way better abs. Can you hear anything?", "Howard: Not yet. What are you doing?", "Raj: I\u2019m listening.", "Howard: Can\u2019t you face the other way and listen?", "Raj: I can\u2019t do anything right for you, can I?", "Howard: What the hell is he up to?", "Raj: He is kind of a weirdo. Maybe he\u2019s got Leonard Nimoy chained up in there. Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.", "Howard: Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?", "Raj: Howard, please, you can\u2019t treat the man differently just because he\u2019s disabled. That\u2019s not okay.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: If you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019ve been staring through the peephole, I\u2019m trying to get a look at this guy who\u2019s coming over to Penny\u2019s.", "Sheldon: To be honest, I didn\u2019t know you were here.", "Leonard: It\u2019s not a big deal. He\u2019s just in her history class. They\u2019re working on a project together. I don\u2019t even know why I care. You know what, I don\u2019t care.", "Sheldon: You think you don\u2019t care?", "Leonard: This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.", "Sheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. I mean, statistically speaking, I\u2019m sure you have something to worry about.", "Leonard: What do you mean?", "Sheldon: Well, if we assume your looks are average, yeah, right off the bat, fifty percent of men on Earth are more attractive than you. That\u2019s one point five billion handsome lads standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.", "Leonard: Well, yeah, but this isn\u2019t just about looks. I\u2019m, I\u2019m way above average in a lot of other things.", "Sheldon: Not height, vision, athleticism, or ability to digest dairy products.", "Leonard: I\u2019m talking about important things like emotional maturity.", "Sheldon: You were just spying on your girlfriend through a peephole.", "Leonard: I liked it better when you thought I wasn\u2019t here.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t have attractive qualities. Your choice of friends is impeccable, you\u2019re a good sleeper, and last but not least, you buy the grapes I like. You\u2019re a real catch compared to some snoring guy with a fridge full of lousy grapes.", "Leonard: None of this matters. I trust that Penny cares about me, and nothing\u2019s gonna happen with this guy.", "Sheldon: Well, unless of course he\u2019s a skilled hypnotist.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: While unlikely, it\u2019s still a statistical possibility. She might be performing sexual acts with him and not even know it.", "Leonard: Now you\u2019re just being ridiculous.", "Sheldon: Am I? The mind\u2019s a mysterious thing, Leonard. He could be having the time of his life while she thinks she\u2019s a chicken pecking for corn.", "Scene: The university basement.", "Raj: Look at us, sneaking around in the middle of the night like a couple of cat burglars.", "Howard: I think we\u2019re more like ninjas.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want to be a ninja, I want to be a cat burglar.", "Howard: Fine, I\u2019ll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.", "Raj: No, we both have to be the same thing. Okay, we\u2019re ninjas.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Raj: But next time, we\u2019ll be cat burglars.", "Howard: It\u2019s locked.", "Raj: Are you sure?", "Howard: Yes, I\u2019m sure. Now, you stand guard, I\u2019m going to\u2026", "Raj (trying door): It\u2019s locked.", "Howard: Just keep an eye out. I\u2019ll have this open in a minute.", "Raj: When did you learn how to pick locks?", "Howard: When I was starting to do magic in junior high, I thought I could be an escape artist like Harry Houdini.", "Raj: How did that work out?", "Howard: Pretty good. I managed to escape friends, popularity, and every party thrown in a twelve mile radius. There. Ready?", "Raj: Hold on, hold on.", "Howard: What?", "Raj: Sheldon is a very smart man, and he obviously wants to keep this a secret.", "Howard: Yeah, so?", "Raj: What if it\u2019s booby-trapped?", "Howard: Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m one step ahead of him.", "Raj: Great, what\u2019s your pl\u2026 (Howard pushes him inside)", "Howard: Are we good?", "Raj: Yeah. Huh. Forty-three? What the hell does that mean?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. The solution to an equation?", "Raj: Maybe. It\u2019s a prime number. Encryption systems are built on prime numbers.", "Howard: What kind of secret does Sheldon have to encrypt?", "Raj: He\u2019s always been very cagey about what he puts in his egg salad to make it so tasty.", "Howard: It\u2019s paprika.", "Raj: Really? Well, oh, okay, one mystery solved.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Voice from Outside: Okay, good night.", "Penny (off): Thanks, Cole. See you at school.", "Cole (off): See you.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll be right back.", "Sheldon: I thought you left a long time ago.", "Leonard (rushing to catch up with Cole): \u2018sup?", "Cole: Hey.", "Leonard: You, uh, moving into the apartment on the fifth floor?", "Cole: No, I was just visiting a friend.", "Leonard: Oh, cool. That cute blonde on four?", "Cole: Yeah. You know her?", "Leonard: I, well, I see her around. I like to keep my distance because her boyfriend is a pretty scary dude.", "Cole: Really?", "Leonard: Yeah. He\u2019s ganged up.", "Cole: She told me he\u2019s a scientist.", "Leonard: That\u2019s the name of his gang. The Scientists. They are crazy.", "Cole: Well, thanks for the tip.", "Leonard: No problem, brother. Stay frosty. (Cole leaves. Leonard spots Penny watching.) We\u2019re still dating, right?", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Alex: Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.", "Leonard: Hey, Alex, and call me Leonard. Dr. Hofstadter is my father. And my mother. And my sister. And our cat. Although, I\u2019m pretty sure Dr. Boots Hofstadter\u2019s degree was honorary.", "Alex: May I join you, Leonard?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Alex: Thanks.", "Leonard: Hey, Alex, let me ask you something. My girlfriend knows this guy at school. He\u2019s got an English accent.", "Alex: Ooh, I love English accents.", "Leonard: Yeah, you all do. Anyway, I feel like he\u2019s hitting on her. She says he\u2019s just being nice and that I should trust her.", "Alex: It\u2019s probably harmless. You know how it is. I\u2019m sure you get hit on all the time.", "Leonard: Right. Because girls are always like, ooh, that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms and gets a lot of ear infections. I got to get me some of that.", "Alex: I don\u2019t know, I bet it happens more than you realize.", "Leonard: Trust me, it doesn\u2019t.", "Alex: You sure? You\u2019re cute, you\u2019re funny. Maybe you\u2019re getting hit on, and you don\u2019t even know it.", "Leonard: Really?", "Alex: Yep, pretty sure.", "Leonard (laughs): Okay, I got to get back to work. Thanks for listening.", "Alex: No problem.", "Leonard: Hope-hope no girls rip my clothes off on the way.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s office.", "Raj: Come on, we\u2019re smart guys. We can figure this out.", "Howard: Forty-three. What is forty-three? Besides my mom\u2019s neck size.", "Raj: It\u2019s the atomic number for technetium.", "Howard: That stuff\u2019s radioactive.", "Raj: Do you think he\u2019s building a bomb?", "Howard: Ah, it took him two years to put together that Lego Death Star, I\u2019m not worried.", "Raj: Ooh, this could be something. forty-three is the number of calories in half a cup of fat-free yoghurt.", "Howard: Why would you know that?", "Raj: I\u2019m sorry. We can\u2019t all eat whatever we want and still stay thin. Wait, in the Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, isn\u2019t forty-three the answer to the question of life, the universe,and everything?", "Howard: That\u2019s forty-two, dumb-ass.", "Raj: Hey, hey. Feelings.", "Howard: We should stop. I\u2019m exhausted.", "Raj: Yeah, me, too. We\u2019ve got more important things to do. Who cares what stupid forty-three means?", "Howard: Not me.", "Raj: Let\u2019s go home. You want to get something to eat?", "Howard: Sounds good.", "Raj: What the balls is forty-three?", "Howard: I have to know!", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Leonard: Hi.", "Penny: Hey, shouldn\u2019t you be out with your gang, spray painting equations on the side of buildings?", "Leonard: Come on, I\u2019m sorry.", "Penny: I just can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t trust me.", "Leonard: I do, of course I do.", "Penny: Then why did you embarrass me in front of my friend, who, by the way, knew exactly who you were?", "Leonard: Really?", "Penny: Your picture\u2019s on my refrigerator.", "Leonard: Oh. You know, I\u2019m really starting to not like this guy.", "Penny: What is your problem? Do you use up all your thinking at work and then have none left over for when you get home?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. It-it-it\u2019s hard sometimes. Everywhere you go, guys hit on you, even if I\u2019m standing right there. And they\u2019re all taller than me. Why is everyone taller than me? You know what, this is all in my head. It\u2019s my problem, not yours.", "Penny: Leonard, why do you always do this? Listen to me, you\u2019re the one I\u2019m with. You know I love you, so will you please relax because you\u2019re driving me crazy.", "Leonard: You know that\u2019s the first time you ever said that you love me.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Leonard: We\u2019re just supposed to pretend it\u2019s not a big deal?", "Penny: That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re gonna do because you\u2019re about to make me cry, and we both know if I start crying, you\u2019re gonna start crying.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right, you should go.", "Penny (crying): All right.", "Leonard (crying): She loves me. (Receives text) Hey, it\u2019s Alex. Nice having coffee with you. If you want to talk more, I\u2019m always available. Smiley face, smiley face. What a friendly girl.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: Okay, picture\u2019s up. Looks like the camera\u2019s working.", "Raj: That\u2019s good quality video.", "Howard: It better be. It\u2019s the spare camera for the Mars rover.", "Raj: How did you get your hands on that?", "Howard: Million dollar camera, ten dollar lock.", "Raj: Oh, my God, here he comes. This is it.", "Howard: What the hell is that thing?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know.", "Sheldon (on screen): This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Experimental log. Wormhole generator test forty-four.", "Howard: Wormhole generator test? (On screen a wormhole appears)", "Sheldon: The first forty-three parallel universes I\u2019ve checked proved to be empty. I see no reason to suspect universe number forty-four will be any different. (Puts his head in the wormhole)", "Howard: Oh, my God!", "Raj: Holy crap!", "Sheldon (with an alien creature stuck to his face): Oh! It\u2019s eating my face!", "Raj: Aah! It\u2019s eating his face!", "Sheldon (throwing alien onto the laptop): I found your webcam and replaced the video feed. You two should be ashamed of yourselves.", "Raj: Sheldon, we\u2019re really sorry.", "Howard: Yeah, really sorry.", "Sheldon: Sorry? You may not realize it, but I have difficulty navigating certain aspects of daily life. You know, understanding sarcasm, feigning interest in others, not talking about trains as much as I want to. It\u2019s exhausting. Which is why, for twenty minutes a day, I like to go down to that room, turn my mind off and do what I need to do to recharge.", "Howard: But what are you doing in there?", "Raj: And what does forty-three mean?", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t need to know, you don\u2019t deserve to know, and you will never know.", "Raj: Yeah, well, I know how to make your egg salad now.", "Scene: The room in the basement. Sheldon enters, takes out a box, takes a beanbag from the box, then starts playing keepie-uppie,", "Sheldon: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight\u2026 Drat. I\u2019m never going to get to forty-three again. One, two, three, four\u2026 Rats."]}
