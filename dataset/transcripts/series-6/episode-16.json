Did you Heimlich him?", "Penny: No. I said, oh, my God, I think that old guy\u2019s choking, and then one of the busboys Heimlich\u2019ed him.", "Leonard: You\u2019re a hero.", "Penny: Yeah, that was the point of the story.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah, speaking of work, do you know if you have Thursday night off?", "Penny: Um, I think so. Why?", "Leonard: What do you mean, why? It\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Penny: Oh, right. Yeah, we can do something.", "Leonard: You could be a little more into it.", "Penny: No, I\u2019m into it, I\u2019m into it. Just, there\u2019s so much pressure to make the night special, and it never works out.", "Leonard: Okay, well, this time it\u2019s going to be different. Because I am like a romance ninja. You don\u2019t see it coming, and then bam, romance, watch out, hearts, kisses, love, ooh-ya!", "Penny: You know, sometimes I think I\u2019ve made you so much cooler than you used to be, and then you go and do that.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Sheldon: So, in conclusion, I believe the painful sensation felt after passing a meal of spicy chillies is proof that the rectum does possess the sense of taste.", "Amy: I concur, but you changed the subject. What are we doing for Valentine\u2019s Day?", "Sheldon: Oh, you caught that, did you?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Howard (on phone): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay! Okay.", "Raj: Everything okay?", "Howard: Bernie\u2019s a little cranky since she\u2019s been working, like, 17 hours a day. And I\u2019ve got a lot on my plate, too, because I\u2019ve been busting my tail playing Assassin\u2019s Creed.", "Raj: Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on for Valentine\u2019s Day?", "Stuart: Not really. Other than hiding all the sharp objects around here and white-knuckling it till morning. What do you got going on?", "Raj: Oh, well, I was going to spend the night with my special little lady, but, uh, she got worms, and then I had to take her to the vet.", "Stuart: There must be something we can do.", "Raj: Well, uh, how about you keep the store open late, and we throw a party for all the people who don\u2019t have dates?", "Stuart That actually sounds kind of nice.", "Raj: Yeah, the theme will be that the greatest love a man can have is the love he has with himself.", "Stuart: That\u2019s good. Or maybe something a little less hand in the pants.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Sheldon: Ah, Alex, excellent. I have a research problem that I believe you can help with.", "Alex: Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you. I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity to contribute to your scientific work.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, no. That\u2019s not going to happen, no. What I need you to do is find a Valentine\u2019s gift for my girlfriend.", "Alex: You realize I passed up an opportunity to work at Fermilab to take this job with you.", "Sheldon: Well, I guess those chaps will have to have someone else buy their girlfriends presents. Now, here is, let\u2019s see, this is, this is about two thousand dollars, um, I think she likes monkeys and the colour grey. Contribute to my work. Ah, kids say the darnedest things.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s lab.", "Leonard: Hey, you coming to lunch?", "Howard: Yeah, one second. Come here. I want to show you something.", "Leonard: What you looking at?", "Howard: Well, I was trying to come up with something really romantic to give Bernadette for Valentine\u2019s Day since she\u2019s been such a pain in the ass.", "Leonard: You can\u2019t find a card that says that?", "Howard: Check it out. I used the atomic force microscope in the material science lab and wrote our initials in a heart one one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.", "Leonard: Oh, that\u2019s cool.", "Howard: A micro-valentine for a microbiologist.", "Leonard: From her micro-husband. That is amazing. How long did this take you?", "Howard: Mmm, about twelve hours. I pulled an all-nighter.", "Leonard: Oh, wow.", "Howard: Yeah, I know, it really took a bite out of my video game time. What are you and Penny doing?", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019m going to take her to a nice restaurant for dinner.", "Howard: Oh, that\u2019s not bad, but as far as romance goes, I think my gift hits it right out of\u2026 (Bumps into chair and drops the slide)", "Leonard: Want to come to dinner with us?", "Howard: Yes, please.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Okay. Amy will be here shortly, expecting the perfect Valentine\u2019s gift, so, you\u2019re up kid. Dazzle me. Go.", "Alex: Okay, I think I have some really great choices. I went on Amy\u2019s Facebook page and read up on her interests.", "Sheldon: Now, see, I never would have thought to do that. Clearly, I made a good choice farming this out to you. But I am telling you, Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot. Anyway, my socks are on. Let\u2019s knock them off.", "Alex: Well, um, I know she loves playing the harp, so I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favourite songs.", "Sheldon: Now, Amy already has a real harp. And it can play any song. What are you trying to pull here?", "Alex: No, I just thought it would be\u2026", "Sheldon: Next.", "Alex: Okay. Um, I know she\u2019s a fan of The Canterbury Tales.", "Sheldon: Mmm.", "Alex: So I found this cool map that illustrates the character\u2019s journey through England. I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.", "Sheldon: But she\u2019s got Google Maps on her phone.", "Alex: I don\u2019t know how to respond to that.", "Sheldon: Well, I hope it\u2019s with a third good option, because these first two, buh.", "Alex: Okay. Well, uh, luckily, I saved the best for last. Since Amy\u2019s a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago Ramon y Cajal, the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells. And I managed to find this signed print.", "Sheldon: Wow. Oh, this is truly remarkable.", "Alex: Thank you.", "Sheldon: I think I\u2019ll keep it for myself.", "Alex: What about your girlfriend?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s too late. I call dibs.", "Scene: a restaurant.", "Penny: This place is really beautiful.", "Leonard: Waugh, romance ninja.", "Penny: Hey.", "Howard: Sorry we\u2019re late.", "Penny: No problem. We just sat down.", "Leonard: Mmm, would you like some wine?", "Bernadette: Yeah, fill her up. I\u2019ll tell you when to stop.", "Penny: Is everything okay?", "Howard: Terrific. Couldn\u2019t be better.", "Bernadette: Oh, bite me.", "Howard: Look, we can still have a nice night. Just tell me where it is.", "Bernadette: Maybe if you did what you said you were going to do, I\u2019d tell you.", "Leonard: Uh, where what is?", "Howard: She hid my Xbox like I\u2019m a child. Yeah, and my mom got me that for my birthday, so if you don\u2019t give it back, I\u2019m telling.", "Bernadette: I\u2019ve been working late every night. All I asked was that he clean the apartment and do one load of laundry. But did he do it? No. He just kept on playing that stupid game. You like pushing buttons so much, try pushing them on the washing machine.", "Howard: I said I\u2019m sorry.", "Bernadette: Sorry doesn\u2019t clean my underpants, buddy.", "Howard: I told you, turn them inside out.", "Bernadette: And I told you to bite me.", "Leonard: Trying to have a magical night here, guys.", "Penny: Oh, son of a bitch.", "Leonard: What?", "Penny: Nothing. Nothing.", "Leonard: No, tell me.", "Penny: It\u2019s just this guy I used to date.", "Leonard: Oh.", "Penny: Until he cheated on me with my friend Gretchen, who\u2019s here with him now.", "Leonard: You\u2019re kidding.", "Penny: And it looks like she lost a lot of weight, damn it.", "Leonard: I know it\u2019s not ideal, but don\u2019t let them ruin our night.", "Penny: No, you\u2019re totally right. She could be skinny \u2019cause she\u2019s dying.", "Leonard: That\u2019s the spirit.", "Penny: You know what, screw them. Our night is going to be way more special than theirs.", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Bernadette: Uh-oh.", "Penny: What? (Penny\u2019s ex is proposing to Gretchen) Oh, you got to be kidding me.", "Gretchen: Oh, my God, yes. Of course I\u2019ll marry you.", "Leonard: Two can play this game. Penny\u2026", "Penny: Get up.", "Leonard: All right.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Raj: It\u2019s nice that all the people who are lonely on Valentine\u2019s Day can come here tonight and be together.", "Stuart: Yeah, I\u2019m really looking forward to it. In fact, there\u2019s no place I would rather be than here.", "Raj: Except on a date with anybody.", "Stuart: Literally anybody.", "Raj: You know, you and I have so much fun hanging out. If you were a girl, all our problems would be solved.", "Stuart: What?", "Raj: Oh, yeah, think about it. We\u2019d hang out, we\u2019d read comic books, we\u2019d see movies. It\u2019d be like the best relationship ever.", "Stuart: That does sound nice.", "Raj: Then I\u2019d take you home, slip off your little black dress and just pile-drive you into oblivion.", "Stuart: What?", "Scene: The restaurant.", "Penny: Oh, I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to marry the girl he cheated on me with.", "Leonard: Isn\u2019t it kind of nice? I mean, he was with the wrong person, and now he found the right person.", "Penny: What, so I\u2019m the wrong person? Maybe you want to be with Gretchen, too.", "Bernadette: They do look happy.", "Howard: Yeah, maybe tonight. But a year from now, he\u2019ll be crawling under the sink looking for his Xbox. Well, he will.", "Leonard: You know what? Why don\u2019t we just forget about them and enjoy our Valentine\u2019s Day?", "Penny: Yes, absolutely. Now they\u2019re doing that phony link-arm-drink thingy. I totally taught him that.", "Leonard: I thought we were letting it go.", "Penny: We were; it\u2019s just, it\u2019s not fair, okay? They\u2019re bad people. It\u2019s not supposed to end happy for them, it\u2019s supposed to end happy for me.", "Leonard: Um, it did end happy for you. You\u2019re here with me.", "Penny: Yeah, yeah, I know.", "Leonard: Okay, this is getting a little hard to not take personally.", "Penny: Oh, come on, don\u2019t make this about you.", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019m not. It\u2019s about you.", "Penny: Yeah, well, whatever, okay? I told you, Valentine\u2019s Day sucks.", "Leonard: This one does, and you\u2019re the reason why.", "Penny: What?", "Bernadette: You know, compared to them, I\u2019m feeling pretty good about us.", "Howard: Me, too. How about we blow off dessert, go home early, I\u2019ll do that laundry.", "Bernadette: Thank you.", "Howard: I love you.", "Bernadette: Love you, too.", "Howard: So where\u2019d you hide it?", "Bernadette: Where you\u2019d never look.", "Howard: Damn it, it\u2019s in the washing machine.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Hello.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Amy: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Sheldon: Okay. Shall we go to dinner?", "Amy: Hang on. As you know, I had planned a traditional evening of romance and gifts.", "Sheldon: Yes, and as you know, I planned to pretend to enjoy it. I\u2019ve been working on this facial expression all day.", "Amy: And I appreciate your effort, but upon contemplation, I decided I was being selfish. So, I cancelled our dinner reservations and came up with an even better way to celebrate Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Sheldon: What is that?", "Amy: By doing none of it. No dinner, no romance, no gifts. We stay here, order a pizza and watch one of your beloved Star War Trek things.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019d love, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: More than anything.", "Amy: Well, then, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.", "Sheldon: Well, I don\u2019t know what to say. This is the most thoughtful gift that anyone\u2019s ever given me. And that\u2019s including an amazing gift that I gave myself earlier today.", "Amy: I\u2019m your girlfriend. That\u2019s my job. And I know gift-giving puts a lot of pressure on you, so whatever you got me, you can return.", "Sheldon: No. No, after everything you didn\u2019t do for me tonight, I want you to have it.", "Amy: What\u2019s this?", "Sheldon: Read it.", "Amy: Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information?", "Sheldon: At the bottom.", "Amy: In case of emergency, please contact\u2026 Amy Farrah Fowler. And there\u2019s my phone number. This is the most beautiful gift you could\u2019ve ever given me.", "Sheldon: Well, I thought, if I have a stroke or a kidney stone, who would I want to share that with?", "Amy: And you picked me.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s like you said, you\u2019re my girlfriend.", "Amy: Oh, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Yeah. Okay. Stop ruining Valentine\u2019s Day and order my pizza.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: Night.", "Leonard: Yep. You know what? That was pretty crappy of you. I mean, all I wanted to do was give you a great night, and it\u2019s like you-you went out of your way to destroy it.", "Penny: Yeah, I know. I\u2019m a total bitch.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not saying that.", "Penny: Well, I am.", "Leonard: Fine, you win. You\u2019re a bitch. Why couldn\u2019t we just have a nice time?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2019cause things are going so well between us lately and I\u2019ve been really happy.", "Leonard: Okay, you\u2019re gonna have to make a lot more sense than that.", "Penny: Obviously, I have some commitment issues.", "Leonard: Glaringly obvious. Go on.", "Penny: As long as things keep going great between us, you\u2019ll keep asking me to marry you, and eventually I\u2019m gonna end up saying yes, and then we\u2019re gonna be married forever, and the whole thing just freaks me out.", "Leonard: Okay. I know I propose a lot. So how about this? I promise I will never ask you to marry me again.", "Penny: What, what do you mean? Are you breaking up with me?", "Leonard: No. No, no, no, no. But if someday you decide you want to get married, you have to propose to me.", "Penny: Really?", "Leonard: Yes. It\u2019s all on you. But I got to tell you, when the time comes, I want the whole nine yards. I want you down on one knee, flowers, I want to be swept off my feet.", "Penny: Yeah, you got it.", "Leonard: And I\u2019m cool with surprises. But nothing on a Jumbotron. I don\u2019t want to cry on a big screen like that.", "Penny: Okay. You know what? This might be the wine talking, but I have a very important question to ask you.", "Leonard: You do?", "Penny: Leonard Hofstadter?", "Leonard: Yes?", "Penny: Will you be my valentine?", "Leonard: Sorry. Maybe next year. I\u2019m just kidding. Romance ninja. Let\u2019s have sex. Waugh!", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Nerdy guy: Thank you, guys, for doing this.", "Raj: We\u2019re glad you could make it.", "Nerdy guy: Usually I spend Valentine\u2019s Day sad and alone. This year, I\u2019m just sad.", "Raj: What is it about this holiday that makes people so unhappy?", "Stuart: I know. I hate myself most of the time, but tonight\u2019s the night I know everyone else does, too.", "Nerdy guy: I think you\u2019re cool.", "Stuart: Great.", "Raj: I got to tell you, we\u2019ve got to stop beating ourselves up like this. Excuse me, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? We\u2019re all here tonight because we have no one to be with. But that doesn\u2019t make us mutants. The only mutants here are in these comic books. We\u2019ve got to stop defining our self-worth by whether or not we\u2019re in a relationship. You know what I see when I look around? I see a room full of great people. So let\u2019s give ourselves a break. We are a community, and as long as we have each other, we\u2019re never truly alone.", "Girl: That was cool. What you said.", "Raj: You really think so?", "Girl: Yeah, I do.", "Raj: Thank you. Uh, would you like to, uh, get a cup, a cup of coffee or\u2026?", "Girl: Okay.", "Raj: Later, losers!", "Scene: Amy\u2019s lab. Phone rings.", "Amy: Hello? Another medical emergency? What\u2019s wrong with him now? I seriously doubt he was bitten by a Chinese bird spider. How exactly does a bump feel Asian? Just put him on the phone. Sheldon, I am not driving over there again. Because I drove over there yesterday for a brain tumour that turned out to be an ice cream headache. Yes, I still want to be your emergency contact. Yes, you can eat your ice cream too fast and also have a brain tumour. I\u2019m on my way. Brain tumour would explain a lot."]}
