{"series": "6", "episode": "19", "transcript": ["Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: What you doing?", "Howard: You said clean up. I\u2019m cleaning up.", "Bernadette: You can\u2019t just throw everything in the closet.", "Howard: Hey, you can tell me what to do or you can tell me how to do it, but you can\u2019t do both. This isn\u2019t sex.", "Bernadette: What if someone looks in there?", "Howard: They\u2019re just coming over for dinner. No one\u2019s gonna look in the closet.", "Bernadette: Well, you don\u2019t know that. What if someone\u2019s looking for the bathroom and they open that door?", "Howard: Could work out. For all we know there\u2019s a toilet in there somewhere.", "Bernadette: Fine. But after tonight we need to get a handle on this mess.", "Howard: You know what we should do? We should show the closet to Sheldon.", "Bernadette: Why?", "Howard: Are you kidding? He\u2019s like a savant at organizing. Everything in his apartment has a label on it. Including his label maker, which has a label that says label maker. And if you look really close at that label maker label, you\u2019ll see a label that says label.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s our guest, we can\u2019t just ask him to straighten our closet.", "Howard: No, we wouldn\u2019t ask him. We\u2019d just show him the closet and let the goblins in his head take it from there.", "Later.", "Howard: Hey, guys, come on in.", "All: Hi.", "Penny: Ooh, it smells good.", "Bernadette: Thanks. And, Sheldon, I know tonight\u2019s the night you eat Thai food, so I went to the Asian market, got all the ingredients and made it from scratch.", "Sheldon: Oh, you shouldn\u2019t have.", "Bernadette: Oh, it\u2019s my pleasure.", "Sheldon: No, you really shouldn\u2019t have. I brought my own.", "Bernadette: You stopped and got him takeout?", "Leonard: I had no choice. He kept kicking the back of my seat.", "Bernadette: Sheldon, I\u2019ve been cooking all day.", "Sheldon: Well, now don\u2019t you feel silly.", "Bernadette: Show him the closet.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: These spring rolls are amazing. Good job, Bernadette.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s the takeout that Sheldon brought.", "Raj: Oh, well, I\u2019m sure they wouldn\u2019t have tasted nearly as good if I hadn\u2019t tried your food first.", "Sheldon: Howard, did you want your clothes arranged seasonally or by colour?", "Howard: Colour\u2019s fine.", "Sheldon: Wrong, they\u2019ll be arranged seasonally.", "Penny: Sheldon, aren\u2019t you gonna spend a little time with Amy?", "Amy: Oh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m used to it. The other day at Whole Foods, he spent an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.", "Sheldon: Yeah, and some thanks I got. The assistant manager chased me out with an artisanal salami.", "Amy: His quirks just make you love him more. Someone please agree with me.", "Scene: The closet.", "Leonard: Sheldon, come on. It\u2019s getting late. Time to go.", "Sheldon: Oh, five more minutes.", "Leonard: That\u2019s what you said five minutes ago. Amy and Penny are already in the car. Let\u2019s move it.", "Sheldon: How come I never get to do anything I want to do?", "Howard: You know, if he really wants to stay and finish, I can give him a ride home.", "Sheldon: Please, Leonard, he said it\u2019s okay.", "Leonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s, wait, I can go home without you? Bye.", "Sheldon: Howard, I have a few questions. I found three bowling pins. Now, do you juggle these, or are you missing seven?", "Howard: Juggle.", "Sheldon: You health nuts kill me.", "Bernadette: Oh, my God, it\u2019s beautiful. Look, he found the juggling pins I hid.", "Sheldon: Uh, just a couple more items. Howard, I found this letter from your dad in a box. Now, based on the content, it could either be filed\u2026", "Howard: Whoa, you opened this?", "Sheldon: Well, I had to find out if it was personal correspondence or memorabilia. Now, as I was saying, based on the content\u2026", "Howard: I couldn\u2019t be less interested. Now, come on, I\u2019ll take you home.", "Bernadette: Howard, don\u2019t you want to know what\u2019s in the letter?", "Howard: If I wanted to know, I would\u2019ve opened it years ago. The closet looks great. Let\u2019s get out of here.", "Sheldon: Wait, can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons to sort on the ride?", "Howard: Do whatever you want.", "Sheldon: Thanks. Oh. Great party.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Leonard: You know, when I first met Howard, he would pull his scrotum out of his shorts and say, aw, I sat in gum.", "Penny: What is your point?", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s just kind of weird how grown up he is now. Happily married guy throwing dinner parties.", "Penny: Really? You couldn\u2019t just say that? You had to tell the scrotum story?", "Leonard: Trying to paint a picture.", "Penny: It was a nice change of pace not eating takeout around a coffee table.", "Leonard: Mm, you know, we could throw a dinner party, too. Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.", "Penny: Sure. Just, when you say dressed up, you mean nice clothes, right? Not, like, capes and tights and crap?", "Leonard: Yeah. Although\u2026", "Penny: No.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Howie, you okay?", "Howard: Yeah, I just couldn\u2019t sleep.", "Bernadette: Told you you shouldn\u2019t have espresso after dinner. I know the little cups make you feel big, but it\u2019s not worth it.", "Howard: It\u2019s this stupid letter.", "Bernadette: Did you read it?", "Howard: No.", "Bernadette: You must be curious.", "Howard: Of course I\u2019m curious. I haven\u2019t seen the man since, oh, I was a little kid. And a letter shows up on my 18th birthday? What\u2019s that about?", "Bernadette: Why don\u2019t you read it? Maybe he apologizes or explains why he left.", "Howard: He abandoned me and my mother. Why does he deserve a chance to explain anything?", "Bernadette: I get that. So, what do you want to do with it?", "Howard: Something I should have done a long time ago. (Sets fire to it)", "Bernadette: Really? Are you sure?", "Howard: Yep.", "Bernadette: Feel better?", "Howard: I do. (Smoke alarm goes off) Great. Neither one of us is tall enough to reach that.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Amy: I can\u2019t believe he set it on fire.", "Bernadette: Yeah, just seeing that letter really freaked him out. And he was already having a tough day \u2019cause he accidentally wore my pants to work. I don\u2019t know why he was upset. They were bigger on him than me.", "Amy: Boy, I\u2019m really curious what was in that letter.", "Bernadette: Me, too, but I guess now we\u2019ll never know.", "Amy: Well, you said Sheldon read it. Why not ask him?", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t do that. What kind of wife would I be if I didn\u2019t respect my husband\u2019s privacy?", "Penny: What if I ask Sheldon, you just happen to be in the room?", "Bermadette: That works.", "Penny: Okay.", "Scene: The laundry room.", "Sheldon: Bleuch. Like cleaning out the entire building\u2019s belly button.", "Penny: Hey, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Oh, hello. What can I do for you ladies?", "Amy: You have something we want.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear. My mother warned me this is what happens to pretty boys in the big city.", "Penny: No, we just want information.", "Sheldon: Oh. Oh, I\u2019ve got that in spades. Ravage me.", "Penny: We heard you read the letter from Howard\u2019s father.", "Sheldon: I did.", "Penny: What did it say?", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t tell you that. I\u2019m bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.", "Amy: Sheldon, that\u2019s not a real thing.", "Sheldon: Well, neither is the rule that you have to hold your girlfriend\u2019s hand at the movies. You know. That doesn\u2019t stop you from pawing at me like you\u2019re a bear and I\u2019m a trash can full of sweets.", "Penny: Why do you even care? Just tell us what it says.", "Sheldon: Control over the information contained in that letter belongs to Howard. By happenstance, I came to know it. That doesn\u2019t give me the right to disseminate it freely.", "Penny: Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette\u2019s closet. Doesn\u2019t that count for something?", "Sheldon: Are you pointing out that California is a community property state, and since Howard and Bernadette are married, the intellectual property contained in that letter is jointly owned by the two spouses?", "Penny: Yeah, obviously.", "Sheldon: Well played. Sometimes I don\u2019t give you enough credit, Penny.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Dude, you made the right choice coming to me for help with this party.", "Leonard: Actually, all I did was invite you.", "Raj: Well, put your mind at ease. I\u2019m here to make sure your dinner party kicks Howard\u2019s dinner party\u2019s ass. Now, the first thing we need is a theme. I\u2019m thinking, ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.", "Leonard: I\u2019m thinking you need a testosterone patch. Penny and I just want to do something low-key. You know, cocktails, light jazz music, hors d\u2019oeuvres.", "Raj: So your theme is I saw a rerun of Mad Men and bought some crab puffs from Trader Joe\u2019s? Hate to miss that.", "Leonard: Hey, where have you been?", "Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. If I was prone to sarcasm, I\u2019d say I was pulling off a major heist at the museum of laundry baskets.", "Leonard: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. I meant, golly, Sheldon, you\u2019ve been gone a long time.", "Sheldon: Oh. Yeah, well, I was waylaid by Penny, Bernadette and Amy. They made me reveal confidential information about Howard\u2019s father.", "Leonard: What information?", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t tell you that. I am bound by closet organizer/organizee confidentiality.", "Raj: Well, come on, we won\u2019t tell anyone.", "Sheldon: Sorry, badgering me won\u2019t work. What you should have said is, It\u2019s pointless to keep this a secret because Penny will tell us.", "Leonard: Fine, then that.", "Sheldon: All right, I\u2019ll tell you. My goodness, everyone\u2019s on their game today.", "Scene: The apartment kitchen.", "Amy: This is really fun.", "Raj: Yeah, it\u2019s nice to get dressed up once in a while.", "Penny: Yeah, and the hors d\u2019oeuvres are delightful.", "Leonard: As is the company.", "Penny: Aw.", "Sheldon: My shirt is itchy and I wish I were dead.", "Leonard: Hey, uh, listen, everybody. Before Howard gets here, et\u2019s all just agree to not bring up the letter from his father.", "Raj: Of course.", "Penny: Sure.", "Amy: Absolutely.", "Sheldon: If I say yes, can we turn off that Latin orgy music?", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Howard: Ridiculous that we still have to walk up all these flights of stairs.", "Bernadette: Yeah, try doing it in heels.", "Howard: I am.", "Bernadette: Wait. There\u2019s something I have to tell you.", "Howard: What?", "Bernadette: I know what was in your dad\u2019s letter.", "Howard: Sheldon, I swear to God, I\u2019m gonna kill you.", "Amy: Hey.", "Bernadette: I made him tell us.", "Howard: What? Us? Who else knows?", "Penny: I know.", "Amy: Me, too.", "Leonard: Same here.", "Raj: Shame on all of you.", "Leonard: You know, too.", "Raj: Couldn\u2019t leave him one friend, could you?", "Howard: So everybody knows what\u2019s in that letter except for me?", "Sheldon: Yes, it\u2019s six against one. Stand down, sir.", "Howard: How could you do this?", "Bernadette: I\u2019m sorry.", "Raj: If you want, we could tell you.", "Howard: No, I don\u2019t want to know. I mean, I do, but\u2026 I got to go.", "Amy: Use me as a human shield!", "Sheldon: I panicked. He looked taller than usual.", "Scene: The closet.", "Bernadette (off): Howard?", "Howard: In here.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m sorry. I should have left it alone.", "Howard: It\u2019s okay. Sorry I ran off like that.", "Bernadette: What are you looking at?", "Howard: Uh, pictures of my dad and me when I was a kid.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s nice.", "Howard: I got to tell you, as angry as I am at Sheldon for blabbing, he did a hell of a job organizing this closet. Look at this. Photos of Wolowitz family before father left forever. Check out nine-year-old Howie with cornrows. Neither race was happy to see me with those.", "Bernadette: Think you could take a break?", "Howard: Why?", "Bernadette: Got a little surprise for you. Come on.", "Howard: Oh, honey, I am in no mood to have sex tonight. I\u2019ll lay there if you absolutely have to have it, but\u2026 Oh. What are you guys doing here?", "Leonard: When you left, you weren\u2019t sure whether or not you wanted to know what was in your dad\u2019s letter, so we came up with kind of a cool solution.", "Howard: Oh, yeah, what\u2019s that?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s simple, really. It occurred to me that knowing and not knowing can be achieved by creating a macroscopic example of quantum superposition. The, the principle that a physical system exists partially in all its possible states at once.", "Penny: We were all thinking it, really. It was kind of the elephant in the room, so\u2026", "Sheldon: Anyway, um, I realized that if we each present you with an account of what your father wrote to you, only one of which is true, and then we don\u2019t tell you which one it is, you will forever be in a state of epistemic ambivalence.", "Penny: Yeah. And I said if it wasn\u2019t epistemic, we might as well not do it.", "Bernadette: Sit down, honey.", "Leonard: Raj, you\u2019re up.", "Raj: Okay, um, It was a card for your 18th birthday. Inside it said, Happy birthday, Howard. I love you. Dad. Oh, and it was a Far Side card, the one where the frog has its tongue stuck to the underside of an airplane. Thinks it\u2019s a fly. Silly frog. So funny.", "Leonard: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: It was a map leading to the lost treasure of famous pirate One-Eyed Willy.", "Howard: Nice try. That\u2019s the plot for Goonies.", "Amy: Told you.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t.", "Leonard: Amy.", "Amy: You didn\u2019t know it, but your father was in the auditorium at your high school graduation. And he cried because he was so proud of you.", "Howard: Really?", "Sheldon: Or that\u2019s complete poppycock which Amy made up. It still could be the map.", "Leonard: Penny.", "Penny: It was a letter explaining that your dad wasn\u2019t who he said he was. Eventually, his other life caught up to him, and the only way to keep you and your mom safe was to leave.", "Sheldon: I would like to change mine. The pirate\u2019s name was Peg-Leg Antoine. Now it\u2019s completely different from Goonies.", "Amy: No, it\u2019s not.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t.", "Leonard: Okay, my turn. Your dad wrote about how family is the most important thing, and that you should never throw it away like he did.", "Howard: Hmm.", "Leonard: Bernadette.", "Bernadette: Inside the envelope was a picture of your dad holding you the day you were born. On the back he wrote Howard, my son, my greatest gift. You okay?", "Howard: Yeah. I\u2019m terrific.", "Leonard: So, which one do you think it is, matey?", "Howard: Actually, I don\u2019t want to know. I want all of them to be true.", "Leonard: Well, one of them is.", "Howard: That\u2019s pretty cool. Thank you, guys.", "Penny: Hey, it\u2019s still early. Why don\u2019t we go back and have that party?", "Raj: Yeah,", "Leonard: Yeah, cool.", "Amy: Okay.", "Sheldon: You know, surprisingly, uh, the letter from your father wasn\u2019t the most interesting thing I read in the closet. Bernadette\u2019s diary has some saucy passages.", "Bernadette: Sheldon, don\u2019t you dare.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s nothing to worry about. Your secret\u2019s safe with me.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s more like it.", "Sheldon: Although copyright law would allow me to quote snippets in the context of a review.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Bernadette: Glad you\u2019re feeling better.", "Howard: Me, too. If I\u2019d known we were gonna be dancing, would have worn my flats.", "Penny: This turned out pretty well, huh?", "Leonard: Yeah, I think so.", "Raj: I agree. That is, if you\u2019ve never been to or heard of a party before.", "Amy: If you\u2019d let me pierce your brain with a hot needle in the right place, you\u2019d be happy all the time.", "Sheldon: Uh, Penny, I, I have a couple of questions about your closet. Is there any reason you\u2019re keeping this dead goldfish?", "Penny: Damn, I forgot to feed him. And that I had him.", "Sheldon: Well, now, did you also have a dog? Because I found what appears to be a battery-operated chew toy.", "Penny: Party\u2019s over! Party\u2019s over!"]}
