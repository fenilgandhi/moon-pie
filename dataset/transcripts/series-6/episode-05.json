{"series": "6", "episode": "05", "transcript": ["Scene: The Comic Book Store", "Howard: Oh, hey, Stuart, I got you a little souvenir from my trip to space.", "Stuart: Well, Howard, that\u2019s very nice of you.", "Leonard: Yeah, maybe. Open it first.", "Howard: It\u2019s my official NASA portrait.", "Stuart: To Stuart, your comic book store is out of this world. Just like the guy in this picture was.\u201d", "Sheldon: For the record, he also thinks the Walgreens and the dry cleaners are out of this world.", "Howard: That\u2019s not true. At the Walgreens I was over the moon for their store-brand antacids.", "Raj: Hey, Stuart, I see you\u2019re getting ready for your Halloween party.", "Stuart: Yeah, it\u2019s my annual attempt to meet women. Ninth time\u2019s the charm.", "Raj: Would you like me to help? I do have a certain je ne sais quois when it comes to soirees.", "Stuart: Thanks, but I can\u2019t afford je ne sais quois. How much for just quois?", "Raj: You know, you don\u2019t worry about money. I\u2019ll take care of everything.", "Stuart: Really?", "Raj: Yeah, you\u2019ll love it. Ain\u2019t no party like a Koothra-party.", "Howard: But you know what wasn\u2019t a party? That hotel in Kazakhstan they put you up in before the launch. I mean, it\u2019s your last night on Earth. You\u2019d think you\u2019d get one porn channel.", "Leonard: Have you noticed that Howard can take any topic and use it to remind you that he went to space?", "Sheldon: Interesting hypothesis. Let\u2019s apply the scientific method, perform an experiment.", "Leonard: Okay. Hey, Howard, any thoughts on where we should get dinner?", "Howard: Anywhere but the Space Station. On a good day, dinner was a bag full of meat loaf. But, hey, you don\u2019t go there for the food, you go there for the view.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s fascinating. Let me see if I can duplicate the result. Howard, I\u2019ve always thought the lemon was an underrated fruit. Care to weigh in?", "Howard: Not really.", "Sheldon: Oh, well.", "Howard: You know, people say the Soyuz capsule was a lemon. But, hey, that baby got me to space and back.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory Bar", "Amy: Ladies night at the Cheesecake Factory. Does it get any better than this?", "Penny: I hope so.", "Amy: Question. Do you think your husband\u2019s fondness for turtlenecks is an expression of longing for his missing foreskin?", "Penny: It\u2019s not getting any better. (Text tone) Ugh. It\u2019s Leonard. He wants to go costume shopping later.", "Bernadette: I thought you liked Halloween.", "Penny: I do, it\u2019s just he wants to go to that party at the comic book store. A lot of the guys that hang out there are kind of creepy.", "Bernadette: Like my husband?", "Amy: And my boyfriend?", "Penny: I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry, Amy. You were saying something about Howard\u2019s foreskin?", "Bernadette: Nice try, but you have to go to that party because we\u2019re going.", "Penny: Yeah, I\u2019m gonna go. It\u2019s just not my idea of a good time.", "Bernadette: Leonard does thing he doesn\u2019t like to make you happy.", "Penny: Well, yeah, he\u2019s my boyfriend. Isn\u2019t that, like, his job?", "Amy: Then what\u2019s your job?", "Penny: Letting him make me happy.", "Bernadette: I just think in relationships you get back what you put into them.", "Amy: That\u2019s not always true. Last night I gave Sheldon my best come-hither look, and he responded by explaining how wheat came to be cultivated.", "Penny: I guess I could probably try a little harder.", "Bernadette: You could start by taking an interest in his work.", "Penny: Yeah, that\u2019s kind of a problem.", "Amy: Why?", "Penny: Not really clear on what he does.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s an experimental physicist.", "Penny: Yeah, I\u2019m not really clear on what that means.", "Amy: He takes hypotheses and designs protocols to determine their accuracy.", "Penny: Yeah, you\u2019re really just making it worse.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: What kind of tea would you like?", "Amy: I think I\u2019m gonna try green tea mixed with lemon zinger.", "Sheldon: Two tea bags in one cup? You\u2019re not at a rave.", "Amy: So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking, since this is gonna be our first Halloween party as boyfriend and girlfriend, I thought it might be fun for us to go in a couples costume.", "Sheldon: I couldn\u2019t agree more.", "Amy: Really? I find that inconsistent with everything I know about you.", "Sheldon: Oh, oh, on the contrary. Couples costumes are one of the few benefits of being in a relationship. Now imagine this, you and I entering Stuart\u2019s party and all eyes turn to see America\u2019s most beloved and glamorous couple.", "Amy: Yeah?", "Sheldon: R2-D2 and C-3PO. Dibs on Threepio.", "Amy: Sheldon, when I said couples costume, I meant like Romeo and Juliet or Cinderella and Prince Charming, not two robots from some silly movie I don\u2019t even like.", "Sheldon: Okay, I\u2019m gonna let that slide because I know you\u2019re hopped up on tea bags.", "Amy: I make compromises for you all the time. Just this once, can\u2019t we find something that we\u2019re both happy with?", "Sheldon: Fine. How about one of the most beguiling and influential couples of the 20th century? Hewlett and Packard. Dibs on Hewlett. What? You want to be Hewlett?", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s laboratory.", "Penny: Anybody home?", "Leonard: Hey, what are you doing here?", "Penny: I just thought I\u2019d stop by and say hello.", "Leonard: Oh, what a nice surprise. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever seen my lab before.", "Penny: No, I know. It\u2019s long overdue. So, what ya doing? Better not be building a robot girlfriend.", "Leonard: No. Although Howard was making some real strides in that area until he met Bernadette.", "Penny: You\u2019re kidding.", "Leonard: Nope. Now the Lisatronic 3000 just sits in a box waiting for the phone to ring.", "Penny: Ooh! What\u2019s going on in here?", "Leonard: Oh, no, no, no, don\u2019t look in there.", "Penny: What, is it secret?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s a nitrogen laser. It\u2019ll cook your eyeball like a soft-boiled egg.", "Penny: Oh. You might want to put a sign on it.", "Leonard: Sign right there.", "Penny: Ah. Danger. Sure, sure. Yeah. What\u2019s, what\u2019s that?", "Leonard: Uh, that is an integrated ion trap and time-of-flight mass spectrometer.", "Penny: Wow. High-techie-techie. What\u2019s this little box?", "Leonard: That is a pencil sharpener.", "Penny: Ooh, low-techie-techie. So, what are you working on right now?", "Leonard: It\u2019s actually pretty neat.", "Penny: Yeah?", "Leonard: Yeah. It\u2019s a front-projected holographic display combined with laser-based finger tracking. Here, I\u2019ll show you. We\u2019ll just put this pencil over here.", "Penny: Sharp. Thanks to the machine we saw earlier.", "Leonard: Very good. And then a laser will map the reflective surface, and voila. (A floating 3D image of the pencil appears. Leonard moves it around with his finger)", "Penny: Wow. That is amazing.", "Leonard: You know, there\u2019s a foundational idea in string theory that the whole universe may be a hologram.", "Penny: What do you mean? (Leonard flicks a switch. The hologram changes to a view of the planet Earth). Oh! Wow!", "Leonard: Uh-huh. Well, the holographic principle suggests that what we all experience every day in three dimensions may really (changes view to solar system) just be information (changes view to the galaxy) on a surface located at the farthest reaches of our cosmos. (Starts the galaxy spinning) So it\u2019s possible that our lives are really just acting out a painting on the largest canvas in the universe.", "Penny: Hmm.", "Leonard: What?", "Penny: Sometimes I forget how smart you are.", "Leonard: You should visit more often. What are you doing?", "Penny: Take off your clothes.", "Leonard: What? Here? Now?", "Penny: Yeah. You got a problem with that?", "Leonard: No, no. It\u2019s kind of crazy. I\u2019ve never fooled around in the lab before.", "Penny: Really? Never?", "Leonard: No. I did have a shot with the Lisatronic, but the extension cord wasn\u2019t long enough.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Raj: Before I forget, I\u2019d like your opinion on the menus I\u2019ve prepared for the Halloween party. The theme is food that goes bump in the night.", "Howard: Creature from the Black Forest Ham Lagoon.", "Raj: On Sesame seed Bunzillas.", "Sheldon: Night of the Living Garlic Bread?", "Raj: It\u2019s funny because bread sounds like dead.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, but these are just ordinary foods with the names bent into tortured puns. The dishes themselves are in no way Halloweenie.", "Raj: Ooh, Hallow-weenies! That\u2019s a good one. They\u2019ll pair nicely with my Draculoni and Cheese. How do I do it?", "Howard: That reminds me, I was thinking about wearing my NASA jumpsuit as a costume. But then I realized everyone would be, like, where\u2019s your costume? Why are you wearing your work clothes, you nut?", "Leonard: Hello, boys.", "Sheldon: What are you smiling at?", "Leonard: Nothing.", "Howard: You know where\u2019s there\u2019s a lot of nothing.", "All: Space.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: Boy, it\u2019s nice to sleep in a bed with gravity again. Did I tell you about the night my retainer floated out of my mouth and into the air lock?", "Bernadette: Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.", "Howard: So, here we are, just a couple of young newlyweds. What to do? What to do to you? Astronaut Wolowitz, reporting for booty. Preparing thrusters. We have liftoff. Are we clear to jettison that nightgown?", "Bernadette: Okay, we need to talk.", "Howard: What?", "Bernadette: Howie, I know you went to space. I\u2019m incredibly proud of you. But you might want to try and not bring it up every minute.", "Howard: I don\u2019t talk about it every minute.", "Bernadette: Tonight at dinner you went on bout it for an hour straight.", "Howard: What was I supposed to talk about? We were eating at Johnny Rockets.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m just saying, people are getting a little tired of it.", "Howard: So, I did this amazing thing and I\u2019m never allowed to mention it?", "Bernadette: Of course you can. But maybe a good rule would be to wait for people to bring it up.", "Howard: Okay, no problem. It won\u2019t happen again.", "Bernadette: I love you.", "Howard: I love you, too. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I dreamed I was in bed here with you when I was\u2026 you know. What, I can\u2019t even point?", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s lab.", "Leonard: So, basically, this is what\u2019s called mag-lev technology. It uses very powerful electromagnets to create a force strong enough to overcome gravity. Here, you hold this.", "Penny: Whoa! That\u2019s heavy.", "Leonard: Yeah. Oh, uh, you don\u2019t have on any jewellery, do you?", "Penny: No. Why?", "Leonard: A grad student forgot to take out one of his piercings. Now he\u2019s on a transplant list waiting for a nipple his size. Now watch this.", "Penny: Whoa! That is very cool.", "Leonard: Sometimes I like to turn this on and pretend I\u2019m the super villain Magneto.", "Penny: Getting a little less cool, Leonard.", "Leonard: But what I really am is a very smart scientist who understands the mechanics of the universe and is wearing the sexy black underwear you bought him.", "Penny: There we go.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Raj: So, I thought the photo booth for the party could either be creepy like a mummy\u2019s tomb, or they also have the Tardis from Doctor Who.", "Sheldon: A Tardis makes no sense. It\u2019s a time machine from a science-fiction show. It has nothing to do with Halloween. That being said, if you don\u2019t get a Tardis, you stink and your party stinks.", "Raj: Do you have a preference?", "Howard: I don\u2019t care. Get the Tardis.", "Sheldon: Yes! This party just became a major rager.", "Raj: Oh, by the way, can I borrow your bullwhip and fedora?", "Howard: Yeah, sure, whatever.", "Raj: I was thinking of dressing up as Indiana Jones\u2019 mocha-skinned love child. Indian Jones.", "Howard: Clever.", "Raj: What\u2019s wrong with you?", "Howard: Nothing.", "Raj: Oh, Howard, I\u2019ve got a party to plan. Don\u2019t make me pull it out of you.", "Howard: Okay, here it is. Bernadette said you guys are all sick of me talking about my trip to space. Is that true?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Raj: No.", "Sheldon: We seem to have different approaches here. I was going for helpful honesty. I have no idea what you\u2019re doing.", "Raj: It\u2019s called being nice.", "Sheldon: Okay. If you think being nice will get him to shut up, I\u2019ll try it.", "Howard: You know what, guys? Never mind. I just won\u2019t talk about the greatest achievement of my life ever again.", "Sheldon: Look at that, the problem solved itself.", "Leonard: Hello, boys.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: What if we were to go as dinner table favourites salt and pepper?", "Amy: You know salt makes me retain water and my cousin William was ground to death in a pepper factory accident. How about Raggedy Ann and Andy? I loved them growing up.", "Sheldon: No, I don\u2019t think so. Those dolls represent three things I do not care for, clowns, children and raggediness. I think it\u2019s a lost cause.", "Amy: No. There are certain things that say to the world, I have a boyfriend, and he\u2019s not made up. Matching costumes, hickeys and sex tapes. Pick one.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s a hickey?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. Howard and Bernadette are dressed as smurfs.", "Bernadette: How do I look?", "Howard: Fine.", "Bernadette: Uh-oh, is someone a little blue? Come on, Howie, that\u2019s like the funniest thing I\u2019ve ever said in my life. What do you say? You ready to go?", "Howard: To tell you the truth, I\u2019m not really in the mood.", "Bernadette: What are you talking about? It\u2019ll be fun. All your friends\u2019ll be there.", "Howard: Yeah, some friends. They all think I\u2019m boring. Maybe you should go without me.", "Bernadette: No, if I\u2019m there alone, people might think I\u2019m just a really short person from Avatar.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry. I just don\u2019t want to go.", "Bernadette: Hey, I just spent the last three hours colouring myself blue. I\u2019m gonna be washing paint out of my Smurf for a month.", "Howard: Fine. Two weeks ago I was an astronaut.", "Bernadette: Yeah, well, now you\u2019re a Smurf. Keep walking.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Penny: Oh, my God, you guys look adorable.", "Bernadette: Thanks, so do you. Slutty cop?", "Penny: No, sexy cop. Slutty cop only came with a skirt and two badges.", "Bernadette: And Albert Einstein?", "Leonard: Ja, und later she\u2019s going to arrest me for goink fashter zen da shpeed of light.", "Penny: I thought we said in the car, no accents?", "Leonard: Sorry, Officer.", "Girl dressed as a Witch: Hello. It\u2019s a great party.", "Stuart: Thank you.", "Witch: The monster foods, they\u2019re really fun.", "Stuart: Oh, yes, thank you. I like to think of fun things like that because I\u2019m fun. I\u2019m not clinically depressed at all.", "Amy: Sheldon, get in here.", "Sheldon: I should\u2019ve picked hickey.", "Stuart: Hey, hey, look at you guys!", "Amy: I\u2019m Raggedy Ann, and he\u2019s Raggedy C-3PO.", "Sheldon: It was a compromise. I lost.", "Raj: Can you believe Stuart\u2019s walking around taking credit for this party?", "Howard: Who cares?", "Raj: What do you mean who cares? Look at what I pulled off here. The DJ\u2019s on fire, there\u2019s a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food. Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese.", "Howard: You\u2019re right, the party\u2019s fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven\u2019t heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old.", "Raj: Is this about the space thing again?", "Howard: Well, I\u2019m not allowed to talk about it, but since you brought it up, I went to space! Space, space! Space! Space, space! Space!", "Bernadette: Whoa, Drinky Smurf. Can I talk to you for a second?", "Howard: Great, now I\u2019m in trouble. You happy?", "Bernadette: You, out! You are being very rude.", "Howard: No, I\u2019m not. They\u2019re all being rude. And you\u2019re being rude.", "Bernadette: Me? What did I do?", "Howard (in a squeaky voice): Oh, Howie, stop talking about space so much. Nobody likes it.", "Bernadette (in a gruff voice): I don\u2019t sound like that.", "Howard: You\u2019re my wife. You\u2019re supposed to be on my side.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m always on your side.", "Howard: Then why are you trying to take this away from me? Being an astronaut is the coolest thing I\u2019m ever gonna do. If I stop talking about it, then I\u2019m just\u2026", "Bernadette: Just what?", "Howard: Just plain old Howard Wolowitz again.", "Bernadette: Plain old Howard Wolowitz is the best guy I know.", "Howard: You\u2019re just saying that.", "Bernadette: No, I\u2019m not. I married him. On purpose. Come here.", "Howard: I love you.", "Bernadette: I love you, too.", "Penny (emerging from Tardis): Nothing to see here. Just sexy police business.", "Leonard: Just explaining the theory of relativity. Twice.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Bernadette: Hey, what you watching?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Raj sent me some video of Buzz Aldrin.", "Buzz (on video, handing Halloween candy to children): Here you go. It\u2019s a Milky Way. The Milky Way\u2019s a galaxy in space. I\u2019ve been in space. Here\u2019s a Mars bar. I\u2019m an astronaut. And this one\u2019s a Moon Pie. I walked on the Moon. What have you done?", "Howard: Okay, I get it."]}
