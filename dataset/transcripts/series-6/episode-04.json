We\u2019ll remember you with nostalgic fondness, the way we do the dial-up modem, the VHS tape, or, or Leonard\u2019s gym membership.", "Raj: We\u2019re not kicking him out. Stuart and I have become good friends.", "Sheldon: Okay, one vote for, one vote against. Leonard, you\u2019re the tiebreaker.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t have a problem with Stuart. Besides, he gives us a twenty percent discount at his comic book store.", "Sheldon: Well, I don\u2019t sell my friendship that cheaply.", "Stuart: I can go thirty.", "Sheldon: Welcome aboard, old chum.", "Raj: Okay, the NASA Web site says Howard\u2019s final descent has begun.", "Sheldon: He left a boy, he returns a boy-sized hero.", "Scene: The Soyuz Capsule. Howard is screaming.", "Dimitri: Loops, calm down!", "Howard (singing): Baruch atah, Adonai, Eloheinu. Melech haolam, hamotzi. Lechem min haaretz", "Mike: What\u2019s that?", "Howard: The Jewish prayer for eating bread! We don\u2019t have one for falling out of space! We did it! We\u2019re on the ground! We survived!", "Mike: That was just the parachute. We still have another six miles to go. (Howard screams again)", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The Airport Arrivals Hall.", "Bernadette: Waiting for my husband.", "Man in Suit: That\u2019s nice.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s coming back from outer space.", "Man in Suit: I think this flight\u2019s coming from Houston.", "Bernadette: No, I mean, he\u2026 Never mind. There he is! Howie!", "Various others (all at once): Howie! Howie!", "Howard: Whoa, thank you. Great to be back on Earth.", "Howie Mandel: Uh, I think they\u2019re here for me, Ringo.", "Man in Suit: Mr. Mandel, I\u2019m your driver.", "Howie Mandel: Oh, thanks. That nut job was telling everybody on the plane he\u2019s an astronaut.", "Bernadette: I missed you so much.", "Howard: I missed you, too. Where are the guys?", "Bernadette: Oh, it\u2019s just me.", "Howard: Oh, I get it. They\u2019re waiting back home with a big surprise party. Don\u2019t worry, I can act surprised. (Does)", "Bernadette: No, I told them they could have you tomorrow night. Tonight, you belong to me. (Sneezes) ", "Howard: Gesundheit. You okay?", "Bernadette: I am now that you\u2019re back. Come on, let\u2019s go home so I can tear off those little pants.", "Howard: Great. Just keep in mind astronauts lose a lot of muscle tone in space, so you might have to do most of the heavy lifting.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Sheldon: You know, I am very disappointed that I won\u2019t be able to celebrate Howard\u2019s accomplishment tonight.", "Amy: Me, too. But we\u2019ll see him tomorrow.", "Sheldon: Yes, it\u2019s just that in all the years I\u2019ve known him, he\u2019s never had the opportunity to receive my admiration. I was excited to see the look on his face when it finally happened.", "Penny: You\u2019re unbelievable.", "Sheldon: I know.", "Leonard: All right, Pictionary. What are the teams?", "Penny: How about boys versus girls?", "Sheldon: Oh, that hardly seems fair. But I guess any team that I\u2019m not on has a decided disadvantage.", "Penny: Once again, unbelievable.", "Sheldon: Yeah, once again, I know.", "Penny: All right, round one. Here.", "Sheldon: Got it.", "Penny: Okay. Ready, set, go.", "Amy: Uh, box? Uh, window?", "Leonard: Batman. Batman and Robin. Uh, Wonder Twins plus the monkey. Wonder Twins plus the monkey and Batman.", "Amy: Uh, gift? Uh, Present!", "Penny: Present! Yeah!", "Sheldon: Oh, Leonard. Now, how can you not get that?", "Leonard: In what universe is that a present?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not a present, it\u2019s the present. Look. There\u2019s you and me. There\u2019s Penny and Amy. We\u2019re playing Pictionary. In the present.", "Penny: Oh, my God, we\u2019re gonna kill them.", "Later", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a quark-gluon plasma.", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s asymptotically free partons inside a quark-gluon plasma.", "Leonard: Nothing with quarks.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s an observational rebuttal of the Lambda-CDM model of the universe.", "Leonard: No.", "Penny: It\u2019s a chocolate chip cookie.", "Amy: Yes.", "Leonard: How could you miss that?", "Sheldon: Hey, if you want someone to guess chocolate chip cookie, you draw a glass of milk next to it.", "Leonard: Penny got it.", "Sheldon: Yeah, only after I eliminated all the obvious answers. You\u2019re welcome.", "Later", "Leonard: Oh, uh, uh, uh, sausage. Uh, uh, uh, uh, bratwurst? Oh, oh, a hot dog.", "Amy: Penny, aren\u2019t you gonna draw something?", "Penny: Relax, we got time, this is so fun.", "Sheldon: There.", "Leonard: A solar system. Uh, uh, uh, uh, um, unidentified flying liverwurst? I don\u2019t\u2026", "Amy: Now?", "Penny: Soon.", "Sheldon: Come on, Leonard, I am spoon-feeding this to you.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, uh, Casper the alcoholic ghost?", "Penny: All right, that\u2019s enough. (Draws)", "Amy: Uh, hand. Uh, nail, polish?", "Penny: Yep!", "Sheldon: Wait, no, no. No. The word is Polish. See, look. Polish sausage. And the, the model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer. And then, finally, if that wasn\u2019t enough, which it should have been, this is Madame Curie killing herself by discovering radium, who, although she was a naturalized French citizen, was Polish by birth.", "Penny: Excuse me, the word is polish. See? Small P.", "Sheldon: Ah. So it is. I guess we both share blame on this one.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s Bedroom.", "Howard: Bernie, you okay?", "Bernadette (off): Yeah, I\u2019ll be right there. (Hacking and coughing noises)", "Howard: Did you get a sea lion while I was gone?", "Bernadette: It\u2019s just allergies.", "Howard: Okay.", "Bernadette: Took some Benadryl. I\u2019ll be fine. So, did you miss me?", "Howard: Oh. Are you kidding? Every minute of every\u2026", "Bernadette (has a coughing fit): Ew. Excuse me.", "Howard: Sweetie, we don\u2019t have to do this now.", "Bernadette: Yes, we do. You left right after we got married. This is like our honeymoon. Now, hold on to your hat. Oh. Uh-oh.", "Howard: You okay?", "Bernadette: A little dizzy. Must be the Benadryl. Switch places with me.", "Howard: Okay.", "Bernadette: Now, kiss me. (He does. She starts snoring)", "Howard: Bernadette? Bernie? Bernie?", "Bernadette (waking suddenly): That was amazing. You made me feel things I never\u2026 (starts snoring again)", "Howard: Well, that was quick, and a little gross. Now, I know how she feels.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Hey, Sheldon, you\u2019re always full of fun little facts. Where did the expression got your ass handed to you come from?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t know.", "Penny: I wonder if it\u2019s from, like, ancient Rome where they\u2019d actually chop somebody\u2019s ass off and then go, here. You know, to appease Loseroneous, the god of losers.", "Sheldon: I am not a loser. Pictionary is not a true test of any real intelligence or skill.", "Leonard: Mmm, in all fairness, Pictionary has verbal skills, visual skills. It\u2019s a pretty well-rounded game.", "Sheldon: Lot of big talk from a man who can\u2019t draw a chocolate chip cookie.", "Penny: All right, fine, pick another game. Amy and I will beat you at anything.", "Sheldon: All right. Let\u2019s play Physics Fiesta.", "Penny: Oh, come on, what is that?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a game that I just invented, in which the participants answer physics questions in remedial Spanish. Um, \u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el boson de Higgs?", "Leonard: En el acelerador de particulares.", "Sheldon: Bueno, mi amigo.", "Penny: No, no, we\u2019re not playing some dumb made-up game.", "Sheldon: All games are made up. They\u2019re not found in nature. You don\u2019t just dig in the ground, come across a rich vein of Rock\u2019em Sock\u2019em Robots.", "Leonard: Just pick another game.", "Amy: Why don\u2019t we do something athletic like go over to the university pool and play water polo?", "Leonard: No good, Sheldon doesn\u2019t float.", "Sheldon: That is true. I have a higher than normal body density. If I run too deep a bath, I drown.", "Amy: All right, let\u2019s keep it simple. How about darts?", "Sheldon: No, that\u2019s not fair either.", "Penny: Why not?", "Sheldon: Darts is a bar game. You\u2019ve been frequenting drinking establishments since you were of legal age.", "Leonard: Yeah, that\u2019s when it started.", "Sheldon: Well, regardless, she has a distinct advantage in all tavern-based competitions. Pool, beer pong, wet T-shirt contests, they\u2019re all out.", "Penny: Okay. Just for the record, I have never entered a wet T-shirt contest. I\u2019ve won a few, but that\u2019s just because I spill when I\u2019m drunk, so\u2026", "Amy: We could go to the cadaver lab at UCLA and play real-life Operation.", "Sheldon: No.", "Leonard: Uh-uh.", "Penny: I don\u2019t think so.", "Amy: Are you sure? I mean, the nose doesn\u2019t light up, but if the corpse is fresh enough, sometimes you can get the leg to jerk.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s House.", "Howard: Hey, Ma, twinkle, twinkle, your little star is home. Ma, the chain\u2019s on the door.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard? I thought I wasn\u2019t going to see you till tomorrow.", "Howard: Yeah, well, Bernie\u2019s not feeling well, so I thought I\u2019d stop by, tell you about the greatest adventure of my life, see if you can make me feel bad about it.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, uh, okay, hold on, I\u2019m not decent.", "Howard: All right. Woman hasn\u2019t tied her robe in 20 years. Suddenly she\u2019s not decent?", "Man\u2019s Voice (off): You want me to hide in the closet or go out the back?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Shh, you need to whisper.", "Howard: Ma, who is in there?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Uh, nobody. The TV is on.", "Man\u2019s Voice (off): I only got one sock. Where\u2019s my other sock?", "Howard: Who is that?", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I told you, it\u2019s the TV. Jay Leno lost a sock, it\u2019s hilarious.", "Howard: If you\u2019re busy, I can come back.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Just give me a second. Go, go, go, go.", "Howard (to man climbing out window): Dr. Schneider?", "Dr Schneider: Oh, hello, Howard.", "Howard: What are you doing here?", "Dr Schneider: Um, house call.", "Howard: You\u2019re a dentist.", "Dr Schneider: Yes, yes, I am. I think he\u2019s on to us.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Okay, glasses off. Find Waldo.", "Sheldon: Hurry up, find him, find him.", "Leonard: I\u2019m trying. Don\u2019t yell at me.", "Sheldon: For goodness\u2019 sake, he\u2019s wearing a hat, glasses, and a red striped shirt.", "Leonard: I know what he looks like.", "Amy: Oh, there he is, I got him.", "Penny: Yes, we win again.", "Sheldon: How could you not find him?", "Leonard: Because he\u2019s hard to find. If he was easy to find, the books would be called There\u2019s Waldo.", "Later. Penny and Sheldon have their foreheads on light sabres and are spinning.", "Leonard: 57, 58, 59, that\u2019s one minute.", "Amy: Long division, long division. Go, go, go.", "Leonard: Remember, show your work.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not okay.", "Leonard: Get up, we can\u2019t lose at math.", "Penny: 37.", "Amy: Yes.", "Later ", "Amy: Ready, set, wrestle. (Penny pins Sheldon straight away) One, two, three, pin.", "Penny: Mwah!", "Sheldon: Stop that.", "Penny: Mwah!", "Sheldon: Amy, do something. Amy, help. Amy, stop that. Amy, Penny, both of you, stop it.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: One to beam aboard?", "Raj: Oh, my God, you\u2019re back. Oh, look at you. You, you look like you grew.", "Howard: Yeah. The lack of gravity did decompress my spine, so I\u2019m like an inch and a half taller. I\u2019m going to the DMV tomorrow to get my license changed before I shrink back.", "Raj: Oh, uh, come in, come in. Oh, I, uh, I didn\u2019t think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow.", "Howard: Yeah, well, Bernadette\u2019s a little under the weather and my mom\u2019s kind of under my dentist.", "Raj: Wait, your, your mother is sleeping with your dentist?", "Howard: Former dentist. I need a new one now that I know where his hands have been.", "Raj: So you\u2019re wandering all around by yourself? That\u2019s not the kind of hero\u2019s welcome an astronaut should come home to.", "Howard: It\u2019s okay, you know, we space cowboys don\u2019t do what we do for glory and fame. We leave that to your rock stars and your athletes and your Howie Mandels.", "Stuart: Oh, hey, man, welcome back.", "Howard: Oh, Stuart, thanks. What are you doing here?", "Stuart: I, I kind of live here now.", "Raj: Just until he gets back on his feet, which are looking pretty good in the boots I bought him for his birthday.", "Stuart: Ah, he\u2019s spoiling me and I love it.", "Howard: Wow, so you guys are like buds now?", "Raj: Oh, yeah, we hang out all the time.", "Stuart: Plus, he doesn\u2019t have a girlfriend, I don\u2019t have a girlfriend.", "Raj: It\u2019s like we both had these holes in our lives, but now we fill each other\u2019s holes.", "Stuart: Uh, that sounds a little funny to an American ear.", "Raj: Which part?", "Stuart: Just all of it.", "Howard: Okay, so what do you guys got going on tonight?", "Stuart: Raj is taking me to the Sound of Music sing-along.", "Howard: Sound of Music sing-along? That used to be our thing, but that\u2019s cool.", "Raj: Oh, Howard, it\u2019s still our thing. Come with us, we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll get you a scalped ticket.", "Howard: So I\u2019d be sitting by myself?", "Raj: We\u2019ll switch. You\u2019ll come sit with me after intermission.", "Stuart: So I, I, I\u2019d be sitting by myself during Edelweiss?", "Howard: No, no, you guys go. Have fun.", "Raj: Okay, uh, will I get to see you tomorrow?", "Howard: Absolutely. See you, Stuart.", "Stuart: Yeah, yeah. Is he taller?", "Howard: At least my mother made her boyfriend climb out the window.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: All right, standard state fair pie-eating contest rules are, no hands, first one to clean the pan wins.", "Amy: On the count of three. One, two\u2026", "Sheldon: Wait. I\u2019m a little concerned. Blueberries are rich in antioxidants.", "Leonard: So?", "Sheldon: So, with all those antioxidants, what if I run out of oxidants?", "Leonard: Sheldon, we haven\u2019t won a game all night. Now, you either stick your face in that pie or I\u2019m gonna stick that pie in your face.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s rude.", "Amy: One, two, three, eat.", "Howard: Hey, guys, guess who\u2019s back from space.", "All: Not now!", "Sheldon: Oh, ow, blueberry in my nose, blueberry in my nose!", "Leonard: Snort it down and keep eating!", "Scene: A diner.", "Waitress: You look familiar.", "Howard: I don\u2019t think so.", "Waitress: Yeah, I just saw you on the news. You\u2019re an astronaut.", "Howard: Yes. Yes, I am.", "Waitress: Good for you. How about a piece of cheesecake on the house?", "Howard: Oh, thank you so much. I\u2019ve been having the worst night. I just got back, and my friends don\u2019t care, my wife\u2019s sick, I went to my mom\u2026", "Waitress: You want the cheesecake or not?", "Howard: Yes, please. (Sings) And I think it\u2019s gonna be long, long time till touchdown brings me \u2019round again to find I\u2019m not the man they think I am at home, oh, no, oh, no, I\u2019m a rocket man. (Sneezes) Perfect."]}
