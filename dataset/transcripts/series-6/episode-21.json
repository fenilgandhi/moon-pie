{"series": "6", "episode": "21", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear. Penny, have you been recording shows on our DVR again?", "Penny: No.", "Sheldon: Answer honestly. This is not a trial. That\u2019ll come later.", "Penny: Absolutely not. Help me out here, I can\u2019t afford another demerit.", "Leonard: Yeah. Uh, maybe we were hacked. You know, the Chinese have been hacking everything lately.", "Sheldon: Why would the Chinese make our DVR record Paul Blart: Mall Cop?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a fat guy on a Segway. That\u2019s funny everywhere.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m deleting it.", "Penny: Well, hang on. Maybe the Chinese haven\u2019t finished watching it yet.", "Leonard: You know, if you\u2019re trying to make space on the DVR, why don\u2019t you just get rid of some of the stuff you\u2019ve already watched? Like, um, Alphas.", "Sheldon: No, that\u2019s the season two finale. That was quite the cliffhanger. I\u2019m going to re-watch it before season three starts.", "Leonard: There is no season three. They cancelled that show.", "Sheldon: Well, they can\u2019t cancel it. It ended on a cliffhanger.", "Leonard: They did.", "Penny: Uh, Sheldon, there are two dumplings left. Do you want them?", "Sheldon: Dumplings? Don\u2019t you understand what\u2019s going on here?", "Penny: As a rule, no.", "Sheldon: That show ended with all the residents of New York either dead or unconscious. Oh, now I\u2019ll never know what happened.", "Penny: Well, why don\u2019t you make up your own ending?", "Sheldon: Oh, sure, what a wonderful idea. And after that, I\u2019ll make up my own rules of oral hygiene. You know, instead of flossing, I\u2019ll rub pudding on my gums. I\u2019m going to get the number of the SyFy Channel and give them what for.", "Leonard: Oh, please, don\u2019t do that.", "Sheldon: No. They can\u2019t just cancel a show like Alphas. You know? They have to help the viewers let go. Firefly did a movie to wrap things up. Buffy the Vampire Slayer continued on as a comic book. Heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season till we were grateful it ended.", "Penny: I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.", "Leonard: Ah, don\u2019t. If they didn\u2019t want to be yelled at by crazy nerds, they shouldn\u2019t have started a sci-fi channel.", "Credits sequence", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: I think you\u2019re gonna be really happy with this security camera. The optics are great, it\u2019s got infrared technology, and there\u2019s even a backup battery when the power goes out.", "Raj: Whatever. I can see my little princess while I\u2019m at work, right?", "Howard: Why can\u2019t you just watch porn like a regular guy? I need your laptop so I can configure the software.", "Raj: Wait, hold on. This is weird.", "Howard: What?", "Raj: I was Googling that girl I\u2019ve been dating, and I found her blog.", "Howard: Cool. Anything juicy?", "Raj: She said she recently went on a date with a guy named Roger? And he\u2019s Indian? And he\u2019s an astrophysicist, too?", "Howard: You know what\u2019s going on, don\u2019t you?", "Raj: Yes, Mummy was right. American girls are sexually voracious devils.", "Howard: I can\u2019t believe I have to explain this. People change names on blogs to protect their privacy. Roger is Raj.", "Raj: Oh. I always thought, if I had a white name, it would be Gavin.", "Howard: Keep reading. What does it say?", "Raj: No, no, I don\u2019t know if I should. If she wanted me to know about her blog, she would\u2019ve told me. It\u2019s almost like I\u2019m reading her diary.", "Howard: It\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s like. Keep reading.", "Raj: No, this is creepy.", "Howard: Oh, I think we were looking at creepy in the rearview mirror when I put up that camera.", "Raj: It\u2019s not creepy. Don\u2019t listen to him. Oh, look who\u2019s got the sweetest kisses.", "Howard: Should I go?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: With all the TV Sheldon was talking about, I had the greatest idea ever. It even blows away my idea for a Star Wars themed coffee shop called Brewbacca\u2019s. You need to watch Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is the perfect show for the two of us. It\u2019s got action and jokes and hot vampires and romance. I cannot oversell this. What do you say?", "Penny: It\u2019s six thirty in the morning.", "Leonard: I thought you grew up on a farm.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon (on phone): Hello, SyFy Network? Yeah, this is your vice president of programming. Now, we have made a horrible mistake regarding Alphas. Yeah, we need to uncancel it immediately. Well, you just put me through to the people who handle that, you tell them it\u2019s me, and I don\u2019t want to answer a lot of questions about if I really am who I say I am, you know? I just. I want this done. No, I am not the person who just called. That man was clearly a cowboy. Yeah, who was plumb concerned about y\u2019all cancelling his favourite show. Why do they keep hanging up on me?", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset. You know, Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort of physical contact in moments like this.", "Sheldon: I am not flying back to Texas just so my mom can give me a hug.", "Amy: Okay. Well, what I think is going on here is you have a pathological need for closure.", "Sheldon: Oh, that\u2019s nonsense. I mean, you tell me stories about your day all the time. I don\u2019t care how they end.", "Amy: You know, I might be able to help you with this. There\u2019s a whole field of behavioural neuroscience that examines ways to retrain your neural pathways so stuff like this bothers you less.", "Sheldon: Yeah, but I just told you, I don\u2019t have a problem with closure.", "Amy: You sure about that?", "Sheldon: Oh, quite sure. (Amy starts a knocking sequence on the table. After staring at her a moment, Sheldon completes it.) That proves nothing.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s office.", "Howard: Ready to go to lunch?", "Raj: Do you think I\u2019m feminine?", "Howard: Yeah. Let\u2019s go.", "Raj: Thanks a lot.", "Howard: What\u2019s going on?", "Raj: I broke down, and I read Lucy\u2019s blog, and in one of the entries she said, when we first met, I struck her as a little feminine.", "Howard: Just a little? That\u2019s great.", "Raj: I have to talk to her about this.", "Howard: Oh, geez, why do you girls always want to talk about things? Listen to me, if she\u2019s writing about your relationship, use it to your advantage. Rig the game.", "Raj: Well, that doesn\u2019t seem fair.", "Howard: Is it fair that girls like confident, normal guys more than nervous weirdos?", "Raj: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve always thought that was unfair.", "Howard: So take what\u2019s in that blog and use it to get her pants off.", "Raj: Why do you have to make everything so filthy? Why couldn\u2019t you just say the blog is like her giving me the key to her heart?", "Howard: The key to her heart. That\u2019s nice. Were you quoting someone or is it tattooed on the small of your back?", "Raj: I was quoting a man who knows a thing or two about women, Sir Elton John.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: So, did you love it? Of course you loved it. How could you not love it? Tell me how much you loved it.", "Penny: It was cute.", "Leonard: Oh, don\u2019t say cute. That\u2019s the worst.", "Penny: What\u2019s wrong with cute?", "Leonard: It just makes things seem small. It diminishes them.", "Penny: So you want me to stop calling your little tushy cute?", "Leonard: You can try, but nobody\u2019s gonna believe you. I just, I don\u2019t understand how you can watch a show that great and not be excited by it.", "Penny: I liked it. I\u2019m excited.", "Leonard: Well, then, tell your face.", "Penny: What do you want from me?", "Leonard: You know what? Never mind. We gave it a shot. Let\u2019s just see what else is on.", "Penny: Oh, come on, don\u2019t be like that.", "Leonard: Well\u2026", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry I called it cute. Let\u2019s watch another one.", "Leonard: Really?", "Penny: Yeah, it was fun. Kind of reminded me of my high school. But instead of vampires, we had meth heads. But both came out at night and had messed up teeth.", "Leonard: All right, cool. I think you\u2019ll like the next one better. All the cheerleaders are suffering from an evil curse.", "Penny: Oh. Well, that\u2019s like my high school, too. But instead of a curse, it was crabs.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: I\u2019ve come up with a series of exercises to help with your compulsive need for closure.", "Sheldon: I take issue with the word compulsive.", "Amy: All I\u2019m saying is, we live in a world where closure isn\u2019t always an op\u2026", "Sheldon: \u2026tion. Okay. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say I have a problem. What would be your plan for addressing it?", "Amy: I\u2019m going to recondition your brain so that the need for completion isn\u2019t so overwhelming.", "Sheldon: By playing tic-tac-toe?", "Amy: Yep. Your turn.", "Sheldon: Oh, Amy. And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies. Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw, none of which will deny me closure. Especially since I\u2019m about to win. (She wipes the board clean.) B-But we didn\u2019t finish.", "Amy: Exactly. How does that make you feel?", "Sheldon: The same way any normal person would. I feel like I want to peel off my own face and tear it in two and then again and again until I have a handful of Sheldon-face confetti.", "Amy: And that\u2019s exactly the feeling we want to address with this course of treatment.", "Sheldon: Or you could pitch in, grab a nostril and help me get this face off.", "Amy: Come on, you can do this.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to feel completely frustrated. To have a desire build up within you and be denied any opportunity for release.", "Amy: Yeah, sounds like a drag.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Okay, help me out here. Why does he love this show so much?", "Bernadette: Well, there was action, it was funny. I mean, you do get that usually the monster chases the pretty girl, but this time the pretty girl chases the monsters?", "Penny: Yippee, it\u2019s backwards. I get it.", "Bernadette: Why does this bother you so much?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, he\u2019s so passionate about so many different things. I just don\u2019t get that way. Do you?", "Bernadette: Well, sure. I\u2019m pretty passionate about science. I remember the first time I looked through a microscope and saw millions of tiny microorganisms. It was like a whole other universe. If I wanted to, I could wipe it out with my thumb like a god.", "Penny: See? I wish I had some of that fire in my life. I mean, I want to care about things and get excited like you guys.", "Bernadette: Well, there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t.", "Penny: You think?", "Bernadette: Absolutely. All we need to do is spend a little time and find something you\u2019re passionate about.", "Penny: Ugh, that sounds like a lot of work.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Howard (on webcam): Hey, what\u2019s up?", "Raj: Uh, Lucy\u2019s coming over. I need some advice.", "Howard: However long you think the foreplay should be, triple it.", "Raj: Just tell me which one you think is more manly. This hockey jersey or this football jersey.", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Go with hockey.", "Raj: Good, black is more slimming. Oh, that\u2019s her. I got to go be butch. Toodles. Hey.", "Lucy: Hi.", "Raj: Come in.", "Lucy: Oh, look how cute your little doggy is.", "Raj: Yeah, well, I wouldn\u2019t get too close. If I give the right command in German, she\u2019ll rip your face off.", "Scene: The apartment. Montage of scenes.", "1. Amy (singing): O\u2019er the land of the free, and the home of the\u2026 Next.", "2. (Sheldon is laying out an intricate pattern of dominoes) Amy: That\u2019s quite an impressive layout, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Amy: Let\u2019s box it up.", "Sheldon: Let\u2019s box it up.", "3. (Sheldon is turning the handle on a jack-in-the-box. Just before the end of the tune) Amy: That\u2019s enough. Sheldon, Sheldon, give it!", "4. Amy: Okay, Sheldon, make a wish and blow out the candles. Oops, missed one. Now your wish can\u2019t come true.", "Sheldon: Lucky for you, \u2019cause I wished you were dead.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Lucy: I like your jersey.", "Raj: Thanks. I love hockey.", "Lucy: Oh, cool. So does my dad. We watched it all the time growing up. Who\u2019s your favourite player?", "Raj: Not Brian Boitano, that\u2019s for sure. How\u2019s your burrito?", "Lucy: It\u2019s still a little frozen in the middle.", "Raj: Probably because I didn\u2019t read the instructions. No wrapper\u2019s going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z.", "Lucy: Is something going on?", "Raj: What do you mean?", "Lucy: Well, you\u2019re acting all weird, and I\u2019m pretty weird, so I think I know what I\u2019m talking about.", "Raj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s all those steroids I\u2019ve been taking.", "Lucy: I think I\u2019m gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks.", "Raj: Wait, wait. I, I found your blog here you wrote about me.", "Lucy: Oh. I kind of just write that for myself. I didn\u2019t think anybody actually read it.", "Raj: No kidding. You didn\u2019t make it easy to find. I spent hours digging around online. For the record, you have excellent credit scores. And your diabetic aunt seems to be adjusting to her new leg just fine.", "Lucy: Why were you acting so strange tonight?", "Raj: You called me feminine. And I, I wanted you to think I was more manly.", "Lucy: Raj, I didn\u2019t say feminine was a bad thing. I meant that you\u2019re sweet and thoughtful and your skin looks so much like caramel, I just want to dip an apple in your face.", "Raj: I do have a pretty balls-to-the-wall moisturising regimen.", "Lucy: So, are you okay?", "Raj: Yeah.", "Lucy: Good. Do you even like hockey?", "Raj: No. Bought this at the Staples Center when I went to see Taylor Swift.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: So, I was thinking how excited you get about stuff like Buffy or science or which TV remote you and Sheldon should buy.", "Leonard: The Harmony One was fine. We didn\u2019t need to upgrade to the eleven hundred, which he knows is too big for my hand.", "Penny: See, that\u2019s the kind of passion I didn\u2019t think I had. But then I realized I\u2019m passionate about you.", "Leonard: Oh, my cute little tushy strikes again.", "Penny: No, I\u2019m serious. Look, I\u2019ve always had these plans. I was gonna be in movies and live this glamorous life, and anything less than that just wasn\u2019t worth getting excited about.", "Leonard: Those things can still happen.", "Penny: Oh, obviously it\u2019s gonna happen. Yeah, a psychic at a bachelorette party told me so. Anyway, what I meant was, I shouldn\u2019t wait, you know? I\u2019ve got you, I\u2019ve got Sheldon, all these wonderful friends. My life is exciting right now.", "Leonard: That\u2019s a big deal.", "Penny: It is, isn\u2019t it?", "Leonard: So, does that mean we get to do stuff like talk about cool shows or get dressed up in matching costumes and go to Comic-Con?", "Penny: Leonard, I had an epiphany, not a stroke.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Sheldon: Amy, I must say, I was sceptical at first, but this has truly been a transformative evening.", "Amy: I\u2019m a little surprised to hear you feeling so positive.", "Sheldon: Well, you\u2019re an excellent neuroscientist, you\u2019re a wonderful girlfriend, and\u2026", "Amy: And?", "Sheldon: Doesn\u2019t matter, does it?", "Amy: I\u2019m proud of you, Sheldon. (Exits.)", "Sheldon: And a complete sucker.", "(Montage of sccenes)", "1. (Redraws tic-tac-toe board) Sheldon: Oh, yeah.", "2. (Blows out all candles on the cake)", "3. (Winds up jack-in-the-box until it pops out.) Sheldon: There he is.", "4. Sheldon (singing): And the home of the brave.", "5. (Knocks over first of intricate domino pattern) Sheldon: Don\u2019t stop. Yes, keep going. Just like that.", "Almost there, almost there. Uh-huh-huh!", "Penny: Sheldon, you big weirdo, I want you to know that I love that you\u2019re in my life.", "Sheldon: I love you, too.", "Scene: Later.", "Sheldon: Hello. Uh, is this the Bruce Miller who wrote the season finale of Alphas? Oh, smashing. Yeah, you already sound nicer than the last Bruce Miller who suggested I have sexual relations with myself. Now, down to business. Um, your show ended on a cliffhanger. Could you please tell me how you planned to resolve it? Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. I see. Well, that all stinks. No wonder you got cancelled. Bye."]}
