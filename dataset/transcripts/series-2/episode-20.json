{"series": "2", "episode": "20", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Hu-u-u-uh\u2026. Hu-u-u-uh!", "Leonard: Problem?", "Sheldon: This is Thai food.", "Howard: Here we go.", "Sheldon: We don\u2019t have Thai food on Thursday. We have pizza on Thursday.", "Leonard: Yes, but we all agreed that the third Thursday of every month would be Anything Can Happen Thursday.", "Sheldon: Well apparently the news didn\u2019t reach my digestive system, which, when startled, has its own version of Anything Can Happen Thursday.", "Howard: Come on, the whole idea behind Anything Can Happen Thursday is to get out of this rut we\u2019ve been in lately.", "Sheldon: Rut? I think you mean consistency. And if we\u2019re going to abandon that, then why even call it Thursday? Let\u2019s call it Quonko Day and divide it into 29 hours of 17 minutes apiece, and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat to the mighty god Ra.", "Raj: I could go for some goat.", "Leonard: Sheldon, we agreed we\u2019d do something different tonight.", "Sheldon: All right. Let\u2019s go to the comic book store.", "Raj: We went to the comic book store last night.", "Sheldon: Last night was Wednesday. Wednesday is comic book night. Tonight, we\u2019ll be going on Thursday, because it\u2019s Anything Can Happen Thursday.", "Leonard: Way to think outside but pressed right up against the box, Sheldon.", "Raj: So what are we going to do tonight?", "Howard: If I may proffer a suggestion, in bars all across this great nation of ours, Thursday night is Ladies\u2019 Night. Which means, as the evening progresses, we will get better looking courtesy of 99 cent margaritas and two-for-one Jell-O shots.", "Leonard: Come on, Howard, the odds of us picking up girls in a bar are practically zero.", "Howard: Really? Are you familiar with the Drake Equation?", "Sheldon: The one that estimates the odds of making contact with extraterrestrials by calculating the product of an increasingly restrictive series of fractional values such as those stars with planets, and those planets likely to develop life? N equals R times FP times NE times FL times FI times FC times L?", "Howard: Yeah, that one. You can modify it to calculate our chances of having sex by changing the formula to use the number of single women in Los Angeles, the number of those who might find us attractive, and what I call the Wolowitz Coefficient.", "Raj: The Wolowitz Coefficient?", "Howard: Neediness times dress size squared. Crunching the numbers, I come up with a conservative 5,812 potential sex partners within a 40-mile radius.", "Leonard: You\u2019re joking.", "Howard: I\u2019m a horny engineer, Leonard. I never joke about math or sex.", "Raj: Well, what are we waiting for? Let\u2019s bounce, bitches.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right. It\u2019s Anything Can Happen Thursday, let\u2019s hit the clubs and meet hot women!", "Raj: Here we go. Lock up your daughters! We\u2019re going to hit it and quit it.", "Leonard: Or we could finish eating and go to the comic book store.", "Raj: Also a good plan.", "Howard: Alright, but next Anything Can Happen Thursday, we\u2019re definitely going to a bar.", "Leonard: Oh, absolutely.", "Raj: You heard that, Ladies\u2019 Night ladies? We\u2019re eventually coming for you!", "Sheldon: Fascinating.", "Credits sequence.", "Penny: Oh hey, guys, where\u2019re you headed?", "Sheldon: To the comic book store. You\u2019re probably thinking, the comic book store? On a Thursday? Why, I\u2019ve fallen down the rabbit hole and into a land of madness. What you have failed to take into account, Penny, is that this is Anything Can Happen Thursday.", "Penny: You got me. While you\u2019re there, could pick me up a few comics for my nephew\u2019s birthday?", "Sheldon: I think you mean comic books. Comics are feeble attempts at humour featuring talking babies and anthropomorphized pets found traditionally in the optimistically named funny pages.", "Penny: Leonard, could you pick me up a few comics for my nephew\u2019s birthday?", "Leonard: Sure. What does he like?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s 13. Just pick out anything.", "Sheldon: Just pick out anything? Maybe at the same time we can pick out a new suit for him without knowing his size, or pick out his career for him without knowing his aptitude, or pick out a new breakfast cereal without knowing his fibre requirements or his feelings about little marshmallows.", "Penny: Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.", "Sheldon: Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man, The Marvelous Adventures of Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2099?", "Penny: Leonard?", "Leonard: You know this can go on all night, why don\u2019t you just come with us?", "Penny: Ugh, that\u2019s what I was trying to avoid.", "Sheldon: Oh, I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "\u00a0", "Penny: Oh, what a cute, little store. Everybody\u2019s staring at me.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re more scared of you than you are of them.", "Penny: Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew?", "Sheldon: A superb choice.", "Penny: Oh, great.", "Sheldon: Yeah, provided he has already read Infinite Crisis and 52, and is familiar with the re-establishment of the DC multiverse.", "Penny: What\u2019s a multiverse?", "Sheldon: Get her out of here.", "Leonard: Come on, I\u2019ll help you pick something.", "Raj: That\u2019s right. She\u2019s with us. Guys like that are so pathetic.", "Howard: Tell me about it. Look, a new Batman belt buckle.", "Store clerk: Oh, hey, Leonard. Can I help you find something?", "Leonard: Oh, hey, Stuart. This is Penny. She\u2019s looking for some comic books.", "Stuart: Oh, really. Blink twice if you\u2019re here against your will.", "Leonard: I think we\u2019re fine, Stuart.", "Stuart: Let me know if you need anything.", "Penny: Thanks. He seems like a nice guy.", "Leonard: You mean for someone who\u2019s into comic books?", "Penny: No, no, no, I just meant for\u2026 yeah.", "Leonard: Penny, just because people appreciate comic books doesn\u2019t make them weirdos. Stuart\u2019s a terrific artist. He went to the Rhode Island School of Design.", "Penny: What about the guy over there in the superhero T-shirt tucked into his sweatpants?", "Leonard: Ah, yeah, that\u2019s Captain Sweatpants. He doesn\u2019t really help the point I\u2019m trying to make.", "(Howard and Sheldon are looking through a rack of comic books. Each says \u201cGot it\u201d in turn as they look past each book until they eventually reach the one in the middle when they both together grab the book and shout \u201cNeed it!\u201d)", "\u00a0", "Howard: Let it go, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Why should I let it go? I saw it first.", "Howard: Yes, but I saw it from the front.", "Sheldon: A far less impressive feat.", "Howard: Oh, come on! I need this for my Batman collection.", "Sheldon: I need it for my Robin collection.", "Howard: Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock?", "Sheldon: Why would I gamble? It\u2019s mine. Let go.", "Howard: You let go.", "Sheldon: No, you!", "Leonard: Problem?", "Sheldon: Yes, he won\u2019t let go of my comic book.", "Howard: It\u2019s my comic book!", "Sheldon: Leonard, we need a ruling.", "Leonard: Uh, cut it in half?", "Penny: Excuse me.", "Stuart: Hello again.", "Penny: Hi. What would you recommend as a present for a 13-year-old boy?", "Stuart: A 13-year-old girl. But if you\u2019re dead set on a comic book, try this.", "Penny: Oh, Hellblazer. What\u2019s this about?", "Stuart: A morally ambiguous confidence man who smokes, has lung cancer and is tormented by the spirits of the undead.", "Penny: Well, if that doesn\u2019t make me the favourite aunt, I don\u2019t know what will. Is this me?", "Stuart: Depends. Do you like it?", "Penny: It\u2019s really good.", "Stuart: Yes, that\u2019s you.", "Penny: That\u2019s so sweet, but what if I didn\u2019t like it?", "Stuart: It\u2019d still be you, but I\u2019d feel like an idiot.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t believe it. Stuart\u2019s putting the moves on Penny.", "Howard: I have got to learn how to draw. Hey!", "Sheldon: Once again, defeated by your own prurient interests.", "Raj: Guys, have you seen Stuart all up in Penny\u2019s business over there?", "Leonard: Nobody\u2019s up in anybody\u2019s business, let\u2019s just buy our stuff and go.", "Penny: Okay, you\u2019ve got my number, now, give me the picture.", "Stuart: You drive a hard bargain, but here.", "Penny: All right. So, um, just give me a call.", "Sheldon: So, Leonard, how are you enjoying Anything Can Happen Thursday?", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon has the comic book. ", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Look at that, that\u2019s a dent. Thank you, Howard Ham-Fisted Wolowitz. Did you just shut the TV off in the middle of the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode?", "Leonard: Apparently so.", "Sheldon: Are you ill?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: All right. Then is it fair to say that you\u2019re experiencing some sort of emotional turmoil over the events involving Penny earlier this evening?", "Leonard: When did you pick up on that?", "Sheldon: A moment ago, when you turned off the TV in the middle of }during the classic Deep Space Nine/Star Trek The Original Series Trouble With Tribbles crossover episode. Would you like some advice?", "Leonard: Sure, why not?", "Sheldon: Then, this is the perfect time to launch a blog with an interactive comments section.", "Leonard: Gee, thanks a lot.", "Sheldon: Would you rather I offer my personal insight?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t need any insights. I just want to know why Penny\u2019s more interested in Stuart than me. We\u2019re practically the same guy.", "Sheldon: Oh, I disagree. Stuart is taller, artistic, self-employed and, most significantly, he gets 45 percent off comic books.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right, I really should be asking strangers on the Internet.", "Sheldon: My original point.", "Scene: The stairs.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Chinese food, vintage video games. After the nightmare of Anything Can Happen Thursday, this is Friday night the way it was meant to be.", "Howard: Who\u2019s up for Sheldon-Free Saturday?", "Penny (coming out of apartment): Oh, hey guys.", "Leonard: Hey, Penny\u2026 and Stuart, hey Stuart.", "Stuart: Hey, guys.", "Howard: So what are you kids up to?", "Penny: Uh, Stuart has a piece in an art show that\u2019s opening tonight.", "Leonard: And you guys are going together, great\u2026", "Stuart: It is great. Really great. Freaking awesome. What are you guys doing?", "Penny: It\u2019s Friday night, that means Chinese food and vintage video games, right?", "Sheldon: Vintage doesn\u2019t even begin to describe what we have planned. Tonight, we are playing the classic 1980 interactive text adventure, Zork. It\u2019s the buggy beta version.", "Penny: Wow, Zork. Well, you guys have fun.", "Stuart: Yeah, see you guys.", "Howard: See you, Stuart.", "Leonard: Hey, Howard?", "Howard: Yes.", "Leonard: Take me to a bar with women.", "Howard: Really?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: Okay! Let me just go inside and slip off my underwear.", "Leonard: Why?", "Howard: Well, if I get lucky, I don\u2019t want to be caught in my Aquaman briefs.", "Leonard (to Raj): Do you\u2026? (Raj checks his underwear) Let\u2019s go.", "Scene: A bar.", "Raj: May I have a grasshopper with a little umbrella, please?", "Howard: No, he may not.", "Raj: Why?", "Howard: I\u2019m not sitting here with a guy drinking a grasshopper with a little umbrella.", "Raj: Fine. I\u2019ll have a chocolate martini.", "Howard: Wrong again!", "Raj: Come on, you know I can\u2019t talk to women unless I\u2019m lit up like the Hindu festival of Diwali.", "Howard: Look, there are plenty of bars in Los Angeles where you can order grasshoppers and chocolate martinis, but you wouldn\u2019t have to because there are no women in them.", "Raj: Gotcha. I\u2019ll have a Brandy Alexander.", "Howard: All right, the Three Musketeers just became the Dynamic Duo.", "Leonard: Should we talk to some of these women?", "Howard: It\u2019s way too early in the night for that. See, first we let the lawyers and the jocks thin the herd, and then we go after the weak and the old and the lame.", "Leonard: That\u2019s your system?", "Howard: That\u2019s my system. Oh, and if you spot a chick with a Seeing Eye dog, she\u2019s mine.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: Oh come on. I think it\u2019s nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening.", "Stuart: Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn\u2019t touched all the cheese.", "Penny: Um, you know, it\u2019s kind of early. Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee or something?", "Stuart: Oh, gee, it\u2019s a little late for coffee, isn\u2019t it?", "Penny: Oh, you think coffee, means coffee, that is so sweet. Come on, I think I have decaf.", "Sheldon: Oh, good, Stuart, I thought I heard your voice. Do you have a moment?", "Stuart: Uh, yeah, I guess.", "Penny: Sheldon, we\u2019re a little busy here, so\u2026", "Sheldon: What are you doing?", "Stuart: We\u2019re having coffee.", "Sheldon: Isn\u2019t it a little late for coffee?", "Stuart: It\u2019s okay. She thinks she has decaf.", "Penny: I\u2019ll just go look for it.", "Stuart: What\u2019s up?", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019ve spent the last three hours in an online debate in the DC Comics Batman chatroom, and I need your help.", "Stuart: Oh yeah. Those guys can be very stubborn. What\u2019s the topic?", "Sheldon: I am asserting, in the event that Batman\u2019s death proves permanent, that original Robin, Dick Grayson, is the logical successor to the Bat Cowl.", "Stuart: Ooh, Sheldon, I\u2019m afraid you couldn\u2019t be more wrong.", "Sheldon: More wrong? Wrong is an absolute state and not subject to gradation.", "Stuart: Of course it is. It\u2019s a little wrong to say a tomato is a vegetable, it\u2019s very wrong to say it\u2019s a suspension bridge. But returning to the original issue, Dick Grayson became Nightwing, a superhero in his own right. Batman 2 has to be the second Robin, Jason Todd.", "Sheldon: Has to be? Has to be? I hope you\u2019re being deliberately provocative.", "Penny: I found the decaf!", "Stuart: Oh, great!", "Sheldon: Yeah, herbal tea for me, please.", "Scene: The bar.", "Raj: Barkeep! Alexander me.", "Leonard: How about those two?", "Howard: Nah, they\u2019re eating peanuts, and my allergies, one kiss would put me in Cedar-Sinai for a week.", "Leonard: What about the ones in the corner?", "Howard: Possible, very possible. Do you want the one in the whiplash collar or the one who keeps blinking?", "Leonard: I think Blinky\u2019s cute.", "Howard: You got it, sir.", "Leonard: Wait, so we just go over there?", "Howard: No, we have a little prep work to do. Put this in your mouth. We walk past them, you stumble a bit. I say, sorry, my friend\u2019s had a little too much, and then I start to pull it out of your mouth and say, a little too much fun. Get it? I mean, they\u2019re laughing, we\u2019re laughing, and then we get them up to about a .15 blood alcohol level, and tell them we\u2019re millionaires.", "Leonard: What else you got?", "Howard: Depends. Are you willing to sit on my lap and pretend to be a ventriloquist dummy?", "Leonard: No.", "Howard: I can\u2019t sit on your lap, you don\u2019t know the routine.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Stuart: I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re obviously stuck in a pre-Zero Hour DC universe.", "Sheldon: Of course I am. Removing Joe Chill as the killer of Batman\u2019s parents effectively deprived him of his raison d\u2019\u00eatre.", "Stuart: Okay, you can throw all the French around you want, it doesn\u2019t make you right.", "Sheldon: Au contraire.", "Stuart: Plus, you\u2019re forgetting that the Infinite Crisis storyline restored Joe Chill to the Batman mythology.", "Sheldon: I am forgetting nothing and I resent your tone.", "Stuart: Okay, look, Sheldon, it\u2019s late and I\u2019ve got to get some sleep.", "Sheldon: So, I win.", "Stuart: No, I\u2019m tired.", "Sheldon: So, I win.", "Stuart: Fine. You win.", "Sheldon: Darn tootin\u2019, I win.", "Stuart: Penny, I really had a terrific time. Penny?", "Sheldon: No, no, no, no, don\u2019t wake her. She\u2019ll maul you like a rabid wolverine.", "Stuart: You know, I don\u2019t think that was decaf.", "Scene: The bar.", "Howard: Wait, is this your card or isn\u2019t it? Trust me, this was their card.", "Leonard: I thought you were good at this. You\u2019re always talking about how you go to bars and meet women.", "Howard: I do, all the time.", "Leonard: Well, what happened? We\u2019ve been sitting here all night and the longest conversation you\u2019ve had with a woman was when your mom called.", "Howard: Wow, you\u2019re just going to make me come out and say it, aren\u2019t you?", "Leonard: Say what?", "Howard: You\u2019re weighing me down. I\u2019m a falcon who hunts better solo.", "Leonard: Fine. I\u2019ll sit here. You take flight and hunt.", "Howard: Don\u2019t be ridiculous, you can\u2019t just tell a falcon when to hunt.", "Leonard: Actually, you can. There\u2019s a whole sport built around it. Falconry.", "Howard: Shut up. Let\u2019s just get Koothrappali and go. (They turn to see Raj with his tongue down the throat of a \u201clarger lady\u201d by the bar.) Lucky bastard. It\u2019s got to be that stupid accent of his. (To a girl nearby) Hello. I am Sanjay Wolowitz from Bombay. Okay, I\u2019m stumped.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. He wakes up clutched in the arms of the large lady. Tries to get away. She clutches him tighter. He shrugs and goes back to sleep. "]}
