{"series": "2", "episode": "15", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. The guys are playing Rock Band. Sheldon is on guitar, Howard drums and Raj singing. They are performing the Red Hot Chili Peppers \u201cUnder the Bridge\u201d. As Raj gets into the song, Penny enters and his singing turns into a squawk.", "Penny: Fellas, please.", "Howard: Penny, come on, we were just finding our sound.", "Penny: You found it. It\u2019s the sound of a cat being run over by a lawn mower.", "Leonard (entering on the phone): I\u2019m really very busy. Is there any way that we can put this off until I have more time to prepare? Of course. But, uh, you understand my trepidation.", "Penny: What\u2019s that about?", "Howard: Not a clue.", "Leonard: Can\u2019t we just postpone it till the spring? Maybe next summer?", "Sheldon: This should be fairly easy to deduce. He\u2019s holding the phone to his left ear. Ears do not cross hemispheres, so he\u2019s using the analytical rather than the emotional side of the brain, suggesting that he has no personal relationship with the caller.", "Leonard: No, I didn\u2019t realize it had been so long. Sure, I guess there\u2019s no other choice but to just go ahead and do it.", "Sheldon: He\u2019s referring to an activity he has done before. It\u2019s unpleasant and needs to be repeated. This suggests some sort of invasive medical test, like perhaps a colonoscopy.", "Leonard: Aren\u2019t there any other options? There\u2019s not a lot of room, it\u2019s gonna be uncomfortable.", "Sheldon: Yes, yes. Yeah, I\u2019m definitely going with colonoscopy.", "Leonard: Okay, bye. My mother\u2019s coming to visit.", "Howard: How about that, you were right.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The lobby. Penny finds a woman studying the lift.", "Penny: It\u2019s out of order.", "Woman: Yes, I can read the sign, I\u2019m just pondering the implications.", "Penny: I think it implies that the elevator doesn\u2019t work.", "Woman: Again, I can read the sign. But the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust, which indicates that the elevator has been non-functional for a significant amount of time. Which suggests either a remarkable passivity among the, I assume, 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality.", "Penny: You must be Leonard\u2019s mother.", "Leonard\u2019s Mother: Oh, I don\u2019t know if I must be, but yes.", "Penny: Uh, I\u2019m Penny. I\u2019m his neighbour.", "Leonard\u2019s Mother: Oh, Dr. Beverley Hofstadter.", "Penny: Oh, nice to meet you.", "Beverley: Oh, you\u2019re a hand shaker. Interesting.", "Penny: Uh, why don\u2019t you come with me. I\u2019ll walk you to the apartment.", "Beverley: Oh, all right. Would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way?", "Penny: Yeah, sure, I guess.", "Beverley: All right, you start.", "Penny: Okay. You know, I\u2019ve always been curious. What was Leonard like when he was little?", "Beverley: Oh, I think you mean young. He\u2019s always been little.", "Penny: Right, okay. What was he like when he was young?", "Beverley: You\u2019ll have to be more specific.", "Penny: Oh, um, okay, like, five or six. Five.", "Beverley: Oh, well, at that age he was well enmeshed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development. An outmoded theory, of course, but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis.", "Penny: Yeah, Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist.", "Beverley: Well, that is one of my degrees. My primary field is neuroscience.", "Penny: Oh, well, I\u2019m an actress.", "Beverley: Why?", "Penny: What do you mean why?", "Beverley: Well, there are studies that suggest that many who go into the performing arts suffer from an external locus of identity.", "Penny: Yeah, I don\u2019t know what that means.", "Beverley: Well, it means you value yourself only as others value you, which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs.", "Penny: Oh, well, I had a wonderful childhood.", "Beverley: Tell me about it.", "Slight time shift.", "Penny: I know my dad wanted a boy. I just, I tried being good at sports, but I hated getting dirty!", "Beverley: And then, I\u2019m assuming, you entered adolescence.", "Penny: Uh-huh, he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra, and then he just stopped playing catch with me. I wasn\u2019t Slugger anymore. Your mother\u2019s here!", "Beverley: If you want to have intercourse with that girl, find out what kind of cologne her father wore.", "Leonard: Good to see you, Mother.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Here\u2019s your tea, Mother.", "Beverley: Oolong?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: Loose, not bagged?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: Steeped three minutes?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: Two-percent milk?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: Warmed separately?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: One teaspoon sugar?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: Raw sugar?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Beverley: It\u2019s cold.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll start again.", "Sheldon: I have the same problem with him. My theory is that his lack of focus stems from an over-developed sex drive.", "Beverley:\u00a0 Oh, I don\u2019t know where he would\u2019ve gotten that. Aside from a pro forma consummation of our marriage, his father and I only had intercourse for the purposes of reproduction.", "Sheldon: That seems a fairly efficient arrangement.", "Beverley: Yes, we think so. We\u2019ve both done papers on it. Mine from the neuroscientific point of view and his from an anthropological. Mine, of course, was the only one worth reading.", "Sheldon: Of course. I would very much like to read about your sex life.", "Beverley: Well, it\u2019s all online or you can order it from the Princeton University Press.", "Leonard: Here\u2019s your tea, Mother. So, what are you guys talking about?", "Sheldon: The frequency with which your parents had intercourse.", "Leonard: Swell. If you\u2019re lucky, maybe she\u2019ll show you the PowerPoint presentation.", "Beverley: I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s on my other laptop.", "Sheldon: Aw\u2026", "Leonard: So, Mother, what\u2019s new?", "Beverley: You\u2019ll have to be more specific.", "Leonard: All right. Uh, what\u2019s new with you?", "Beverley: Oh, well, I\u2019ve been having some fascinating menopausal symptoms recently.", "Leonard: Maybe something less personal.", "Beverley: Oh. Your Uncle Floyd died.", "Leonard: Oh, my God. What happened?", "Beverley: His heart stopped beating. I have to urinate.", "Sheldon: What a remarkable woman.", "Leonard: Yeah I, I thought you guys might hit it off.", "Sheldon: I envy you your childhood.", "Leonard: I hate to tell you, but the only warm memories I have of my childhood are of my Uncle Floyd.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re clearly misremembering. Your mother is brilliant, analytical, insightful, and I\u2019m betting she never hit you with a Bible because you wouldn\u2019t eat your Brussels sprouts.", "Leonard: Sheldon, you don\u2019t give your mother enough credit. She\u2019s warm, she\u2019s loving, she doesn\u2019t glue electrodes to your head to measure your brain waves while potty training.", "Sheldon: You were lucky. When I was a kid, if I wanted an EEG, I had to attach my own electrodes.", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Howard: So, Dr. Hofstadter, Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister.", "Leonard: Please, don\u2019t go there, Howard.", "Howard: I understand that unlike Leonard, they\u2019re at the top of their respective fields.", "Leonard: Boy, you suck.", "Beverley: Well, Leonard\u2019s younger brother, Michael, is a tenured law professor at Harvard, and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent gibbon.", "Howard: So, she\u2019s close to curing diabetes?", "Beverley: Why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged gibbon?", "Howard: Wow, you must be very proud.", "Beverley: Why? They\u2019re not my accomplishments. I have to urinate.", "Leonard: Why are you doing this?", "Howard: You know the rules. You brought your mom to work, you must suffer.", "Sheldon: Leonard, I had no idea your siblings were so much more successful than you.", "Raj: Yeah, you\u2019re like the Jar Jar Binks of the Hofstadter family.", "Howard: Oh, meesa think yousa lookin\u2019 so so sad.", "Leonard: You know, rather than mock me, my friends might realize that this is difficult and try to help me through it.", "Raj: Nope, I think mocking you is more fun.", "Howard: Next time, don\u2019t yousa bring mama to work. Okee-day?", "Leonard: That was fast.", "Beverley: Oh, the middle stall was occupied. I\u2019ll have to try again later.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s totally understandable. In bladder voiding, as in real estate, it\u2019s location, location, location.", "Beverley: So, where were we?", "Leonard: Howard lives with his mother and Raj can\u2019t speak to women unless he\u2019s drunk. Go.", "Beverley: That\u2019s fascinating. Selective mutism is quite rare. On the other hand, an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological clich\u00e9.", "Howard: It\u2019s just temporary, I pay rent.", "Leonard: He lives in the same room where his bassinet was.", "Beverley: You know, both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one\u2019s mother can stem from a pathological fear of women. It might explain why the two of you have created an ersatz homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy.", "Howard: Say what? (Raj whispers in his ear) That\u2019s basically what I just said.", "Leonard: You brought your husband to work, you know the rules. Meesa thinking yousa looking pretty sad now too, betcha, betcha.", "Beverley: Leonard, it\u2019s one o\u2019clock, weren\u2019t you going to show me your laboratory at one o\u2019clock?", "Leonard: There\u2019s no hurry, Mother, tell them more about their secret love for each other.", "Beverley: But it\u2019s one o\u2019clock, you were going to show me your laboratory at one o\u2019clock.", "Sheldon: Her reasoning is unassailable. It is one o\u2019clock.", "Leonard: Fine. Let\u2019s go. I think you\u2019ll find my work pretty interesting. I\u2019m attempting to replicate the dark matter signal found in sodium iodide crystals by the Italians.", "Beverley: So, no original research?", "Leonard: No.", "Beverley: Well, what\u2019s the point of my seeing it? I could just read the paper the Italians wrote.", "Howard: Just for the record, we\u2019re not in an ersatz homosexual relationship.", "Raj: Well, then why didn\u2019t you say that to her?", "Howard: Why is it always my responsibility?", "Raj: It\u2019s not always your responsibility. I swear, this is the same thing you did at the comic book store last week.", "Howard: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re bringing that up.", "Raj: I didn\u2019t bring it up. You did.", "Howard: We\u2019ll talk about this later.", "Raj: You always say that, but we never do.", "Sheldon: You went to the comic book store without me.7", "Scene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.", "\u00a0", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: You got alcohol?", "Penny: Your mom still here?", "Leonard: Yep.", "Penny: Come on in. Wait, wait, she\u2019s not gonna come here looking for you, is she?", "Leonard: Oh, relax. She took Sheldon to the hospital to get a brain scan.", "Penny: Oh, my God. What happened?", "Leonard: Nothing. Mother likes looking at brains and Sheldon likes getting his brain scanned.", "Penny: Geez, what a fun couple.", "Leonard: She\u2019s only been here a day and a half and I\u2019m seriously considering alcoholism as a new career path.", "Penny: Hey, I talked to her for five minutes yesterday and I\u2019ve been half bombed ever since.", "Leonard: You can\u2019t let her get into your head.", "Penny: My head, what about yours?", "Leonard: It\u2019s too late for me. My head is her summer house.", "Penny: She was right, you know. The locus of my identity is totally exterior to me.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah, there she is. Hi, Mom.", "Penny: I mean, do you know where I was all morning? Auditioning with 50 other blondes for some stupid antidepressant commercial. And for what? So I\u2019ll finally get my daddy\u2019s approval?", "Leonard: Did you get the part?", "Penny: No, they said I was too perky.", "Leonard: Hey, you want to talk about not getting love from a parent. You know what I used to do when I was little to have some sensation of human contact?", "Penny: Yeah, you grabbed your penis and wouldn\u2019t let go. Your mother told me.", "Leonard: Of course she did. Anyway, that\u2019s not what I was gonna say. When I was ten years old, I built a hugging machine.", "Penny: A hugging machine?", "Leonard: Yeah. I got a dressmaker\u2019s mannequin, I stuffed it with an electric blanket so it would be warm, and built two radio-controlled arms that would hug me and pat my back.", "Penny: Oh, that is so sad.", "Leonard: You know what the saddest part was?", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: My father used to borrow it.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "\u00a0", "Beverley: Your scan data will be very elpful to my research. You have a remarkable brain.", "Sheldon: I know. Although I\u2019ve always hated how my right frontal lobe looks in pictures.", "Beverley: Common complaint among men. Nothing\u2019s ever big enough, except when they get a tumour. Then you never hear the end of it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d love to see a scan of your brain sometime.", "Beverley: Oh, I\u2019ll send you a link, but its physiology is fairly unimpressive.", "Sheldon: Oh, I can\u2019t believe that.", "Beverley: Your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence suggests an attempt at flattery.", "Sheldon: My apologies. I\u2019ve been living with your son too long. Gotten into some bad habits.", "Beverley: Understandable.", "Sheldon: Can I make you a cup of tea?", "Beverley: I doubt it, but if anyone has a chance, it\u2019s probably you.", "Sheldon: I feel very comfortable around you.", "Beverley: I feel very comfortable around you, too.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s surprising because I generally don\u2019t feel comfortable around, well, anyone.", "Beverley: Nor I.", "Sheldon: What are the odds that two individuals as unique as ourselves would be connected by someone as comparatively workaday as your son?", "Beverley: Is that a rhetorical point or would you like to do the math?", "Sheldon: I\u2019d like to do the math.", "Beverley: I\u2019d like that, too.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Penny and Leonard are doing tequila shots. ", "Penny: Okay, now this time\u2026", "Leonard: Uh-huh.", "Penny: You\u2019re gonna lick the salt off my neck, do the shot, and then bite the lime.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t hear anything after lick.", "Penny: Neck, shot, lime. (Leonard starts licking her neck. He is there a long time) Okay, shot, lime.", "Leonard: Right. Ah! Where\u2019s the lime? (Penny has the lime in her mouth) Oh, okay, we\u2019re sharing.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: So, what do you think?", "Beverley: I\u2019m very tempted. I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s appropriate with my son\u2019s roommate.", "Sheldon: Normally, I\u2019d feel the same way. But based on everything I\u2019ve observed about us, I can\u2019t help but speculate we\u2019d be very good together.", "Beverley: True. I\u2019ve had a similar observation. It\u2019s certainly something I could never do with my husband.", "Sheldon: I was hesitant the first time I tried it, but I experienced an unanticipated and remarkable release of endorphins. It\u2019s quite satisfying.", "Beverley: I see what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re appealing to the neuroscientific researcher in me.", "Sheldon: You see right through me, don\u2019t you?", "Beverley: Only when you\u2019re in a CAT scanner.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom. Penny and Leonard are in bed. ", "Leonard: This is actually gonna happen.", "Penny: Honey, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.", "Leonard: You shush, I\u2019m happy, I want to talk about it. You know what my mother would say about this? She would say because you were not loved by your father and I was not loved by my mother, that having sex is our way of making up for the intimacy we didn\u2019t get as children.", "Penny: Why would you bring that up right now?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Foreplay?", "Penny: So you\u2019re saying you\u2019re not having sex with me, you\u2019re having sex with your mother?", "Leonard: Ummm, I\u2019m gonna go with \u201cno.\u201d", "Penny: That is the sickest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "Leonard: Come on, you\u2019re trying to have sex with your father, and I\u2019m okay with that.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s front door. ", "\u00a0", "Penny: Get out!", "Leonard: She said shush. I should have shushed. (Enters apartment. Sheldon and Beverley are inside duetting on Journey\u2019s \u201cAny Way You Want It\u201d on Rock Star.)", "\u00a0", "Scene: The hallway. ", "Leonard: All right, Mother. Um, have a nice flight.", "Beverley: That\u2019s not really in my control, is it? Oh, uh, yes (gives him a very uncomfortable hug.)", "Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, good morning.", "Leonard: Morning.", "Penny: Look, I was just coming over to talk to you.", "Leonard: You don\u2019t have to. Ever.", "Penny: Gotcha.", "Leonard: Good-bye, Mother.", "Beverley: Good-bye, Leonard. So, Slugger, shall we pick up where we left off last time?", "Slight time shift.", "\u00a0", "Penny (in tears): I mean, my mom could\u2019ve just said, \u201cBob, get over it, she\u2019s a girl, move on.\u201d But she didn\u2019t. Not one word.", "Beverley: Interesting. Would you be willing to fly to New Jersey and discuss your relationship with your parents during a brain scan?", "Penny: Would it help?", "Beverley: Well, it would help me."]}
