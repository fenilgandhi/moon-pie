That\u2019s Anais, none of the other girls in the house like her.", "Howard: House? What house?", "Penny: They all live in a house together.", "Howard: A house, where?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. Somewhere in L.A.", "Howard: Wait a minute, you\u2019re telling me that I\u2019m within driving distance of a house filled with aspiring supermodels?", "Penny: Yeah, I guess.", "Howard: And they live together and shower together and have naked pillow fights?", "Leonard (to Penny who has got up to leave): Hey, wh-where are you going?", "Penny: To pay my cable bill.", "Sheldon: All right, pencils down!

Penny did it.", "Sheldon: Why would you do that?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. I was hungry? What\u2019s the big deal?", "Sheldon: The big deal is that nobody touches food on my plate.", "Penny: All right. Look, I didn\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, but that is your second strike.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: You have two strikes. Three strikes and you\u2019re out. It\u2019s a sports metaphor.", "Penny: A sports metaphor?", "Sheldon: Yes, baseball.", "Penny: All right, yeah, I\u2019ll play along. What was my first strike?", "Sheldon: March 18th. You violated my rule about forwarding email humour.", "Penny: I did?", "Sheldon: The photo of the cat who wants to \u201chas cheezburger\u201d?", "Penny: Oh, come on, everybody loves LOLcats.

Strike three.", "Penny: Ooh, strike three.", "Scene: The hallway, Penny exits the guys apartment.", "Penny: I\u2019m banished? What the hell kind of crap is that?", "Leonard: Listen, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll talk to him.", "Penny: Yeah, you do that.", "Leonard: Just so I know, would you be open to taking his class? You can do it online!", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.", "Howard: So based on our triangulation we\u2019ve narrowed down the location of the top model house to three square miles in the Hollywood Hills.", "Raj: Or possibly Durham, North Carolina.", "Howard: When we find it, you want to go with us?", "Leonard: To do what?", "Raj: Party with the pretty girls, dude!", "Leonard: Are you insane? You\u2019re not going to party with them, you\u2019re not even going to get anywhere near that place.", "Howard: That\u2019s what they said to Neil Armstrong about the moon.", "Sheldon: No one said anything of the kind to Neil Armstrong, the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure to put a man on the moon.", "Howard: Well, my fellow Americans, before this year is out we will put a Wolowitz on one of America\u2019s top models.", "Raj: And a large number of people will believe it never happened.", "Penny (arriving): Okay, let me guess.

Coming right up.", "Sheldon: Wait. Excuse me. You forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.", "Penny: Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you? You\u2019re banished from the Cheesecake Factory.", "Sheldon: Why?", "Penny: Well, you have three strikes. One, coming in. Two, sitting down. And three, I don\u2019t like your attitude.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t do that. Not only is it a violation of California state law, it flies directly in the face of Cheesecake Factory policy.", "Penny: Yeah, no, there\u2019s a new policy. No shoes, no shirt, no Sheldon.", "Howard: I bet we could sell that sign all over Pasadena.", "Leonard: Penny, can I talk to you for a minute? Hi.", "Penny: Hi.", "Leonard: Look, here\u2019s the thing, um, I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible and he agrees that he was unreasonable and out of line.", "Penny: Really? Well, that\u2019s great.", "Leonard: Yeah, so just apologize to him, okay?", "Penny: What? I\u2019m not going to apologize to that nutcase.", "Leonard: Oh, come on, it\u2019s easy, he\u2019ll even tell you what to say.", "Penny: Leonard, don\u2019t you get it? If you guys keep going along with his insanity, you\u2019re just encouraging him.", "Leonard: We\u2019re not encouraging. It\u2019s more like knuckling under.", "Penny: Look, I like hanging out with you guys, but I\u2019m not going to apologize for something I didn\u2019t do.", "Leonard: Well, actually, technically, you did do it.", "Penny: That\u2019s strike one, Leonard.", "Scene: The same, some minutes later.", "Penny: There you go, quesadilla, salad, there\u2019s your pizza, and thanks to Sheldon\u2019s heated discussion with my manager one barbecue bacon cheeseburger, barbecue sauce, bacon and cheese on the side.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Penny: Go ahead, eat it. I dare you", "Scene: The living room. Howard on his laptop.", "Howard: That\u2019s it. There\u2019s the house, I found America\u2019s top models!", "Raj: Are you sure?", "Howard: Look, on the roof, Anais and Giselle are sunbathing. European-style.", "Leonard: You can recognize people on Google Earth?", "Howard: Of course not, I got a buddy of mine at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.", "Leonard: NORAD? You\u2019re using military aircraft?", "Howard: It was already targeted to poke around a nuclear reactor in Siberia, I took it an hour out of its way, tops.", "Penny (entering, angry): Okay, where is he?", "Leonard: Sheldon? I just dropped him off at the comic book store. Why?", "Penny: Here. Try and go online.", "Leonard: Problem with the WiFi?", "Penny: No, just try.", "Sheldon (on screen): Greetings, hamburger toucher. You are probably wondering why you cannot IM with your little friends about how much you heart various things. Well, this recorded message is alerting you that I am putting an end to your parasitic piggybacking upon our WiFi. If you want to remedy the situation you can contact the phone company, set up your own WiFi and pay for it, or you may apologize to me.", "Penny: Well?", "Leonard: I reiterate, knuckle under.", "Penny: No, no, no, no, no. It is on. I am gonna introduce your friend to a world of hurt.", "Leonard: Oh, Penny, you don\u2019t want to get into it with Sheldon. The guy is one lab accident away from being a supervillain.", "Penny: I don\u2019t care, I was in junior rodeo, I can hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.", "Howard: No need to neuter the nerd, I can get you back online.", "Leonard: There, see? Problem solved.", "Howard: Voila!", "Sheldon (voice from Howards laptop): Hello, puny insects. As a consequence of your efforts to circumvent my will, everyone is awarded one additional strike.", "Leonard: Thanks a lot, Howard.", "Howard: What are you complaining about? I\u2019m the one who has to take the class again.", "Scene: The hallway. Sheldon is backing out of the apartment. Penny is waiting outside.", "Sheldon: Oh! Hello.", "Penny: Time to do your laundry, huh?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s Saturday night. Saturday is laundry night.", "Penny: I know. Every Saturday at 8:15, easy to anticipate.", "Sheldon: What are you implying?", "Penny: I\u2019m implying that you\u2019re a creature of habit, and if something were to prevent you from doing your laundry on Saturday at 8:15, you might find it unpleasant. (Sheldon hurries away, disturbed) Knuckle under, my ass.", "Scene: The laundry room. Sheldon, holding his laundry, is looking at the machines in dismay.", "Penny: Oh, no, are all the machines taken? What are you gonna do?", "Sheldon: No problem, I\u2019ll just do my laundry another night.", "Penny: Another night? Well, I guess you can try, but deep inside your heart you\u2019ll know that laundry night is always Saturday night.", "Sheldon: Woman, you are playing with forces beyond your ken.", "Penny: Yeah, well, your ken can kiss my Barbie.", "Scene: The hallway, Penny comes storming up the stairs to the guys door.", "Penny (Knock, knock, knock): Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon (knock, knock, knock) Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Yes?", "Penny: Where are my clothes?", "Sheldon: Your clothes?", "Penny: Yes, I left them in the washers and when I went down to get them, they were gone.", "Sheldon: Really? Despite the sign that says \u201cDo not leave laundry unattended\u201d?", "Penny: Sheldon, where are my clothes?", "Sheldon: You know, I do recall seeing some female undergarments. Where was that? Oh, yes, earlier this evening I happened to gaze out the window and a brassiere caught my eye. Do those look familiar?", "Penny: How the hell did you get them up on that telephone wire?", "Sheldon: When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, mwah-ha-ha!", "Penny: Get them down.", "Sheldon: Apologize.", "Penny: Never.", "Sheldon: Well, then may I suggest you get a very long stick and play panty pinata.", "Penny: Look, wait, Sheldon, this has gotten out of hand, okay? I\u2019ve done some stupid things, you\u2019ve done some stupid things, how about we just call it even and move on with our lives?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve done no stupid things.", "Penny: Look, you\u2019ve got to meet me halfway here.", "Sheldon: I am meeting you halfway, I\u2019m willing to concede that you\u2019ve done some stupid things.", "Leonard: Hey, you guys are talking again. Good. What happened?", "Penny: Leonard, remember when I said it was on? Well, now it\u2019s junior rodeo on.", "Leonard: Oh, not junior rodeo. What did you do?", "Sheldon: I had no choice, Leonard, she ruined laundry night.", "Leonard (looking out of window): A-a-a-aw!", "Sheldon: Mwah-ha-ha.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Leonard enters. Penny is taping together a number of long sticks.", "Penny: Telephone wires can\u2019t electrocute you, can they?", "Leonard: No. Look, this has to stop.", "Penny: Oh, no, no, no. It is just beginning.", "Leonard: All right, I really didn\u2019t want to do this, but\u2026 here.", "Penny: What\u2019s this?", "Leonard: Sheldon\u2019s Kryptonite.", "Penny: Oh, my God.", "Leonard: He can never know that I gave that to you.", "Penny: Look, I said I wanted to hurt him, but, but this?", "Leonard: It\u2019ll shorten the war by five years and save millions of lives.", "Scene: The living room.", "Raj: Oh, pause it. That\u2019s it. Confirmed. We now have the address of the top model house.", "Howard: God bless you, Google Street View registered trademark.", "Leonard: Okay, for the record what you\u2019re doing is really creepy.", "Howard: You know what? If it\u2019s creepy to use the Internet, military satellites, and robot aircraft to find a house full of gorgeous young models so that I can drop in on them unexpectedly, then fine, I\u2019m creepy.", "Leonard (into phone, which has just rung): Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. I\u2019ll get him. Sheldon, it\u2019s for you.", "Sheldon: Who is it?", "Leonard: Your mother.", "Sheldon: Oh, good. Hi, Mom. How are you? But, Mom, she keeps sitting in my spot. And, and she touched my food. Okay, yes, I took her clothes, but she started it. No, that\u2019s not fair. Why should I have to apologize? Yeah, I really don\u2019t think this is the kind of thing Jesus concerns himself with. No, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t really know what Jesus thinks about. All right, good-bye. Did you tell on me?", "Leonard: Are you kidding me? I already have two strikes.", "Scene: Outside Penny\u2019s door.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny\u2026 (door opens) I am very, very sorry for what I have done. Here\u2019s your laundry, I rescind your strikes and you are no longer banished.", "Penny: Can I sit wherever I want? No, no, never mind, never mind, that\u2019s, that\u2019s not important. Sheldon, this was big of you. Thank you. I really appreciate it.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Penny: Good night, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Penny.", "Penny: Yes?", "Sheldon: Well played.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility.", "Penny: Understood.", "Scene: The top model house. The doorbell rings. One of the models answers. Howard and Raj are outside wearing blue jumpsuits.", "Model: Can I help you", "Howard: Yes, we here to fix the cable.", "Model: I think we have satellite.", "Howard: That\u2019s what I meant.", "Model: Oh. Okay, come on in.", "Howard: She\u2019s taller than all the women in my family combined.", "Raj: What do we do now?", "Howard: Follow Mrs. Wolowitz."]}
