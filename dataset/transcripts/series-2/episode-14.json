{"series": "2", "episode": "14", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. The guys are studying a complex chart on the whiteboard.", "Leonard: Hmmm.", "Sheldon: The problem appears to be unsolvable.", "Raj: Maybe you could run some computer simulations.", "Howard: There are too many variables. It would take forever.", "Leonard: We\u2019ve got to be missing something. Let\u2019s start again. The movie is playing here at 7:20, here at 7:40, here at 8:10 and here at 8:45.", "Sheldon: Right, these theatres have to be eliminated.", "Leonard: Why? They\u2019re state-of-the-art digital projection, 20-channel surround sound.", "Sheldon: Yes, but they have no Icee machines. Despite my aggressive letter-writing campaign, I might add.", "Raj: What about the multiplex here? The seats are terrific.", "Sheldon: They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines. No amount of lumbar support can compensate for that.", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s gonna take at least an hour to eat, and I don\u2019t see a Sheldon-approved restaurant proximate to a Sheldon-approved theatre.", "Raj: We could eat after the movie.", "Sheldon: Unacceptable, the delay would result in tomorrow morning\u2019s bowel movement occurring at work.", "Raj: Hang on, hang on. There\u2019s a 7-Eleven here. We smuggle Slurpies, which are essentially Icees, in under our coats, after having a pleasant meal either here, here or here.", "Howard: Wow. I don\u2019t see how we missed that.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, in what universe are Slurpies Icees?", "Raj: That\u2019s how we missed it.", "Leonard: Sheldon, would you be prepared, on a non-precedential basis, to create an emergency ad-hoc Slurpie-Icee equivalency?", "Sheldon: Oh, Leonard, you know I can\u2019t do that.", "Howard: Okay, I guess we only have one option.", "Raj: Yep, I don\u2019t see any way around it.", "Leonard: Bye, Sheldon.", "Howard: See ya.", "Raj: Later, dude.", "Sheldon: They\u2019re right, it was the only option.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The hallway. Sheldon is opening the apartment door. Penny comes running up stairs.", "Penny: Ooh, ooh, shut the door, shut the door.", "Sheldon: Why?", "Penny: Just do it! (Penny runs in. Sheldon shuts door. Penny opens door again) Get inside and shut the door.", "Sheldon: Well, you didn\u2019t specify.", "Penny: Is Leonard around?", "Sheldon: He went to the movies without me. It was the only option. I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand which social situation this is. Could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed?", "Penny: The building manager\u2019s showing an apartment downstairs, and I haven\u2019t paid my rent.", "Sheldon: Oh, I see. Penny, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m comfortable harbouring a fugitive from the 2311 North Los Robles Corporation.", "Penny: It\u2019s no big deal. I\u2019m just a little behind on my bills because they cut back my hours at the restaurant and my car broke down.", "Sheldon: If you recall, I pointed out the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light to you several months ago.", "Penny: Well the \u201ccheck engine\u201d light is fine. It\u2019s still blinking away. It\u2019s the stupid engine that stopped working. It cost me like twelve hundred dollars to fix it.", "Sheldon: You know, it occurs to me you could solve all your problems by obtaining more money.", "Penny: Yes, it occurs to me, too.", "Sheldon: Hang on a moment. (He opens a jar. Snakes jump out. He then pulls out a large wedge of money) Here. Take some. Pay me back when you can.", "Penny: Wow, you got a lot of money in there.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s why it\u2019s guarded by snakes. Take some.", "Penny: Don\u2019t be silly.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m never silly. Here.", "Penny: No, I can\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t you need money?", "Penny: Well, yeah, but\u2026", "Sheldon: This is money I\u2019m not using.", "Penny: But what if you need it?", "Sheldon: My expenses account for 46.9% of my after-tax income. The rest is divvied up between a small savings account, this deceptive container of peanut brittle and the hollowed-out buttocks of a superhero action figure who shall remain nameless for his own protection. Or her own protection. Take some.", "Penny: Really? I mean, are you sure?", "Sheldon: I see no large upcoming expenditures unless they develop an affordable technology to fuse my skeleton with adamantium like Wolverine.", "Penny: Are they working on that?", "Sheldon: I sincerely hope so.", "Penny: Okay. Well, thank you. Oh, God, no, I can\u2019t. Sheldon honey, I don\u2019t want things to be weird between us.", "Sheldon: Won\u2019t it also be weird if I have to say hello to you every morning on my way to work and you\u2019re living in a refrigerator box and washing your hair with rain water?", "Penny: I\u2019ll pay you back as soon as I can.", "Sheldon: Of course you will. It\u2019s impossible to pay me back sooner than you can. Assuming you subscribe to a linear understanding of time and causality.", "Penny: I\u2019m regretting this already.", "Scene: Entering the lobby of the building.", "Sheldon: You know, I\u2019ve given the matter some thought, and I think I\u2019d be willing to be a house pet to a race of super-intelligent aliens.", "Leonard: Interesting.", "Sheldon: Ask me why.", "Leonard: Do I have to?", "Sheldon: Of course. That\u2019s how you move a conversation forward.", "Leonard: Why?", "Sheldon: The learning opportunities would be abundant. Additionally, I like having my belly scratched.", "Leonard: Hey, Penny. How was work?", "Penny: Great. I hope I\u2019m a waitress at the Cheesecake Factory for my whole life.", "Sheldon: Was that sarcasm?", "Penny: No.", "Sheldon: Was that sarcasm?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Was that sarca..", "Leonard: Stop it!", "Sheldon: Penny, you appear to have a package here.", "Penny: Oh, thanks. This must be the beret I ordered. A couple of months ago. It was back-ordered.", "Sheldon: Did you know the beret is an example of piece of women\u2019s fashion adapted from male military uniforms? Another fascinating example is the epaulet.", "Leonard: He\u2019s not lying, he does find that fascinating.", "Penny: Okay, whatever. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m running up and down the streets just buying myself berets. I bought one, like, a month ago, and it was back-ordered, look, it finally arrived, all right?", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: Oh, my God, would you just get off my case?", "Leonard: Weird.", "Sheldon: Oh, good, that was an unusual interaction. I wasn\u2019t sure.", "Leonard: Did you guys have an argument?", "Sheldon: No.", "Leonard: Well, you clearly did something to aggravate her.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m at a loss. If you like, you can review my daily log of social interactions and see if there\u2019s a blunder I overlooked.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Here you go. Oh, you owe me another two dollars. The price of mu-shu pork went up.", "Howard: It\u2019s getting tougher and tougher to be a bad Jew.", "Leonard: Here you go, Penny. Shrimp with lobster sauce.", "Penny: Thank you, Leonard. What\u2019s my share?", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s my treat.", "Penny: No, really, how much?", "Leonard: It\u2019s, whatever. Ten, eleven dollars.", "Penny: Well, which is it, ten or eleven?", "Leonard: Fourteen fifty, but it\u2019s no biggie, you\u2019ll get the next one. (Raj whispers something to Howard)", "Penny: What?", "Howard: He was just wondering if he wore skintight jeans and a tank top if he\u2019d get his shrimp lo mein for free.", "Penny: What are you saying? That I\u2019m using my body to get dinner? That I\u2019m some kind of Chinese food prostitute?", "Howard: Yeah, Raj, what are you saying?", "Penny: \u2018Cause let me tell you something, buddy, I pay my own way in this world, okay? I don\u2019t rely on anybody! (Raj runs out of the room) What was that about?", "Howard: He has a nervous bladder when he\u2019s stressed out. Kind of like a puppy.", "Penny: Here, Leonard, ten, eleven, twelve, uh, fourteen dollars.", "Leonard: It was fourteen fifty, but it\u2019s okay.", "Sheldon: Oh, good. Dinner\u2019s here.", "Penny: Yes, dinner\u2019s here, and I\u2019m having some. I\u2019m having takeout food.", "Sheldon: Okay.", "Penny: You\u2019re damn right it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve been having leftovers at the restaurant for like four days, and I wanted something different. So sue me.", "Sheldon: Forgive me, Penny, but that would be the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.", "Penny: Sheldon, look, I will pay you back as soon as I can. You just have to give me more time.", "Leonard: Oh, wait, you lent her money?", "Penny: She needed money. You seem under pressure. Did I not lend you a sufficient amount? Because I can give you more.", "Penny: Oh, you know, you would just love that, wouldn\u2019t you? Yeah. You would just love to open up your little snake can and throw some money at the girl who can\u2019t pay her bills.", "Leonard: Where are you going?", "Penny: Going home, where I won\u2019t be interrogated like a criminal. I forgot my fortune cookie.", "Sheldon: In case either of you have larceny in your heart, you should know that I\u2019ve moved my money out of the snake can.", "Leonard: But if you\u2019re ever short, there\u2019s always a couple of fifties in Green Lantern\u2019s ass.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: A little mood lighting, huh?", "Penny: Yeah. When I didn\u2019t pay my bill, the Department of Water and Power thought I would enjoy the ambience.", "Leonard: Yeah, they\u2019re very considerate that way.", "Penny: I used Sheldon\u2019s money to pay my rent, then I had like fourteen dollars left over.", "Leonard: Fourteen dollars, huh?", "Penny: Put it back in your pocket, or I\u2019ll find some other place to put it.", "Leonard: Back in the pocket it goes. Look, you do understand that Sheldon really doesn\u2019t care when he gets the money back. It\u2019s actually one of the few idiosyncrasies that doesn\u2019t make you want to, you know, kill him.", "Penny: Yeah, well, that\u2019s not really my big problem.", "Leonard: So you\u2019re a little behind on your bills. Everybody gets behind on their bills.", "Penny: Yeah, I know, it\u2019s just, this wasn\u2019t the plan, it wasn\u2019t supposed to go this way.", "Leonard: Well, what was the plan?", "Penny: Um, waitress for six months and then become a movie star.", "Leonard: Was there a plan B?", "Penny: TV star.", "Leonard: It\u2019s probably not as bad as you think. Let\u2019s take a look. Maybe we can find some corners to cut. Oh, here\u2019s something, if you don\u2019t have electricity, then you probably don\u2019t need cable. Just a suggestion. 170 dollars for acting classes?", "Penny: Oh, no, I can\u2019t give up my acting classes. I\u2019m a professional actress.", "Leonard: You\u2019ve had an acting job where you got paid?", "Penny: That is not the definition of professional.", "Leonard: Actually, it kind of\u2026 let\u2019s keep looking. Whoa, what\u2019s eighteen hundred dollars to the Los Angeles County Superior Court?", "Penny: Oh, that\u2019s nothing.", "Leonard: Nothing? It sounds like you got caught speeding going 4,000 miles an hour.", "Penny: Well, remember Kurt?", "Leonard: Your ex-boyfriend?", "Penny: Yeah. He got arrested for taking a whiz on a cop car.", "Leonard: What?", "Penny: He was drunk.", "Leonard: I would hope so.", "Penny: Anyway, he had a bunch of outstanding tickets and a bench warrant, so I, you know, I paid his fines.", "Leonard: Did he pay you back?", "Penny: No, but he will.", "Leonard: And that\u2019s based on the inherent credit-worthiness of people who get drunk and urinate on police vehicles?", "Penny: Leonard, I\u2019m not gonna call up Kurt and ask him for money.", "Leonard: Well what are you gonna do?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know, but I may have to find a cheaper place to live.", "Leonard: Oh, no. Oh, you don\u2019t want to do that.", "Penny: Why not?", "Leonard: Well, moving is a big deal. You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes, and if they\u2019re not clean, then your books smell like melons, and it\u2019s just, like\u2026 Why don\u2019t you just get a roommate and stay here?", "Penny: Well, do you know anybody?", "Leonard: Well, I\u2019m sure the guy living with Sheldon wouldn\u2019t mind moving in with you.", "Penny: Oh, Leonard, honey, if we started living together, I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep my hands off you.", "Leonard: Really?", "Penny: And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money.", "Scene: The apartment.", "\u00a0", "Howard: Ugh. This mu-shu pork\u2019s burning a hole through my duodenum.", "Raj: Leviticus 11:3: \u201cOnly that which parteth the hoof and cheweth the cud among the beasts shall ye eat.\u201d", "Howard: Hey, do I mock you with the Bhagavad-Gita every time you scarf down a Whopper?", "Leonard: Hey, what\u2019s going on?", "Raj: We\u2019re on a quest through the Valley of Fire to acquire the sacred crown.", "Howard: You want the Valley of Fire? It\u2019s right here.", "Leonard: Hey, you guys want to go on a real live quest?", "Sheldon: Outside? I just made cocoa.", "Leonard: \u2013 Come on. It\u2019ll be fun.", "Howard: What is it?", "Leonard: Do you guys remember Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend Kurt? (They all hold their hands above their heads) Yeah, that\u2019s him. It turns out he owes Penny a lot of money, and I\u2019m gonna go get it from him.", "Who\u2019s with me?", "Howard: Ooh, double sixes.", "Leonard: Really? You\u2019re just gonna let me go by myself?", "Raj: Oh, cool, I got a sword.", "Leonard: I could use some help.", "Raj: Here.", "Leonard: You guys are unbelievable, you play a game to simulate adventure, but when there\u2019s real adventure out there in the real world, you just wimp out.", "Sheldon: Leonard, do you not recall the last time we visited this gentleman, we returned home without pants?", "Leonard: I do.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? Because your proposal suggests that you don\u2019t.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not afraid of him.", "Sheldon: All right. Leonard fairly calls the question, who is in favour of abandoning our game and confronting Penny\u2019s steroid-infused ex-boyfriend in a suicidal mission to extract money from him? Say hi to Kurt for us.", "Leonard: Excuse me. When Frodo left the Shire to take the one ring to Mordor, didn\u2019t Samwise, Pippin and Merry go with him?", "Sheldon: They did.", "Leonard: Well?", "Sheldon: They had a terrible time of it, Leonard.", "Raj: Plus, no one stole their pants.", "Leonard: Fine. Just enjoy your little game. I\u2019ll make this quest on my own.", "Howard: Leonard, wait. Take a jacket, it\u2019s spritzing a little.", "Leonard: You guys suck. (Leaves. Comes back) Come on, please? He\u2019s so big.", "Scene: Outside Kurt\u2019s door.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Okay, is everyone clear on the plan?", "Howard: Yes. Koothrappali\u2019s going to wet himself, I\u2019m gonna throw up, Sheldon\u2019s gonna run away, and you\u2019re going to die. Shall we synchronize our watches?", "Leonard: Guys, there are four of us and one of him.", "Sheldon: Which means his triumph will be even larger. Minstrels will write songs about him.", "Leonard: Okay, how about this? I\u2019ll do the talking, you just stand behind me and try to look formidable.", "Raj: I should\u2019ve peed before we left.", "Kurt: Yeah?", "Leonard: Hi, Kurt.", "Kurt: Lenny, right?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t really go by Lenny, but that\u2019s okay. Um, you remember Sheldon, Howard and Raj.", "Kurt: No. What do you want?", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t remember me? How could he not remember me?", "Leonard: Sheldon, not now.", "Sheldon: I remember him.", "Leonard: Okay, here it is. Penny\u2019s in kind of a financial jam, and the money that you owe her would go a long way to solving her problems.", "Kurt: And she sent you to get it from me?", "Leonard: No, no, she\u2019s too proud to ask for the money. I, on the other hand, feel you should honour your debt.", "Kurt: You do?", "Leonard: Feel is a kind of a\u2026 it\u2019s a strong word. Um, I just think it would be a nice gesture on your part.", "Kurt: She\u2019ll get it when she gets it.", "Howard: Well, there you go. Problem solved.", "Raj: A successful quest. Now let\u2019s go find a gas station with a clean bathroom.", "Leonard: No, the problem isn\u2019t solved. He just blew us off.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve got it. He didn\u2019t remember me because the last time we met I was in a Halloween costume.", "Howard: Come on, Leonard, let\u2019s go", "Leonard: No. You can leave if you want to. I\u2019m gonna see this through.", "Howard: Okay. (They leave) ", "Leonard: I guess, technically, that was my fault. (Knocks) I\u2019m not leaving here without Penny\u2019s money.", "Kurt: What happened to your backup?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t need backup. I have right on my side. And I\u2019m wearing cargo shorts under my pants.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: Congratulations. You may not have succeeded in getting cash, but you did secure a formal acknowledgment of the debt. (Leonard has \u201cI owe Penny $1800, Kurt\u201d written on his forehead.) ", "\u00a0", "Howard: Maybe we should have your head notarized.", "Raj: If anybody cares, I still have to pee.", "Scene: Outside the apartment. Penny knocks. ", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hey, is Sheldon here?", "Leonard: Yeah. Hang on. Sheldon!", "Penny: Nice hat.", "Leonard: It\u2019s kind of a fashionable look these days.", "Penny: Maybe if you\u2019re working on a tuna boat.", "Sheldon: Hello, Penny.", "Penny: Sheldon, here is your money. Thank you very much. It helped a lot.", "Sheldon: Sarcasm?", "Penny: No.", "Sheldon: Darn. I can\u2019t seem to get the hang of that.", "Leonard: Hey, I know it\u2019s none of my business, but where did the money come from?", "Penny: Well, I cut back my expenses like you said and picked up a few more hours at the restaurant, but the biggest thing was, out of the blue, Kurt shows up and gives me the money he owes me.", "Leonard: Really? Did he say why?", "Penny: Yes, he said he was feeling guilty and wanted to do what was right.", "Leonard: That\u2019s it? Did he give any reason as to why he came to this moral epiphany?", "Penny: Nope. I just think he\u2019s really changed. We\u2019re having dinner tomorrow night, and I get to wear my new beret. Bye, guys.", "Leonard: Bye.", "Sheldon: Well done, Leonard. The true hero doesn\u2019t seek adulation, he fights for right and justice simply because it\u2019s his nature.", "Leonard: Penny\u2019s hooking up with her jerk of an ex-boyfriend and I have indelible ink on my forehead!", "Sheldon: That\u2019s your badge of honour, your warrior\u2019s wound, if you will. I was wrong, minstrels will write songs about you.", "Leonard: Great.", "Sheldon (sings): There once was a brave lad named Leonard, with a fi-fi-fiddle-dee-dee. He faced a fearsome giant, while Raj just wanted to pee."]}
