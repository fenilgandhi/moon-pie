{"series": "2", "episode": "16", "transcript": ["Scene: The paintball range.", "Howard: That was close.", "Raj: God, I love the smell of paintballs in the morning.", "Howard: Yeah, still funny, Raj.", "Leonard: There\u2019s no way we can get to the ridge. The Chemistry Department has us completely cut off.", "Howard: But what about the creek bed?", "Sheldon: The Pharmacology Department controls that, and they\u2019re all hopped up on experimental steroids.", "Raj: Well, that\u2019s it then, we\u2019re doomed.", "Sheldon: I think the time has come to acknowledge that we are paying the price for some of us failing to attend my Physics Department paintball strategy meeting.", "Howard: I told you my mom has spider veins, I had to take her to the laser clinic.", "Sheldon: And I told you I wanted to see a doctor\u2019s note.", "Raj: We need a plan. How about Operation Hammer of the Gods?", "Leonard: I forget. Which one is Hammer of the Gods?", "Raj: We hide behind the Dumpsters in the parking lot and ambush people when they come to pee.", "Howard: No go. The Dumpsters are deep in Astronomy Department territory.", "Leonard: No, that shouldn\u2019t be a problem, Venus is up during the day. They\u2019re probably just all staring at the sky.", "Sheldon: All right, what we need now is a tactical retreat. Did you see the episode of Stargate where they found themselves on a planet with a culture based loosely on Earth\u2019s Athens and Sparta? Not important. Leonard, Raj and I are going to burst out the door and run away, Howard will cover us.", "Howard: Why don\u2019t I run away and you cover me?", "Sheldon: Because you chose your mother\u2019s veins over victory. On three. One, two, three, go!", "Howard: I had to take her! It\u2019s almost bathing suit weather!(Another player bursts through the door)", "I surrender! Don\u2019t shoot! They went that way!", "Leslie: Howard, I\u2019m on your team.", "Howard: Oh, Leslie, thank God.", "Leslie: Where\u2019s the rest of your squad?", "Howard: Ah, they left me here to die. What about yours?", "Leslie: Dead, all of them.", "Howard: Sorry.", "Leslie: Don\u2019t be. It was friendly fire. They just wouldn\u2019t listen.", "Howard: Well, we\u2019re surrounded, so I guess there\u2019s nothing for us to do but wait to be captured or killed.", "Leslie: Hmm, that\u2019s the worst part, the waiting.", "Howard: All the while knowing that there\u2019s a paint pellet out there with your name on it.", "Leslie: Yeah, the big wet ball of death. Kind of makes you feel more alive, doesn\u2019t it?", "Howard: It kind of does.", "Leslie: I say we make every moment count.", "Howard: I agree. How exactly do we do that? (Leslie kisses him)", "Leonard (voice): Howard, why aren\u2019t you covering us? We\u2019re getting slaughtered out here!", "Howard: War is hell.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Raj: Did you guys see the new budget memo that went out this morning?", "Leonard: Yeah, more cutbacks.", "Sheldon: Unacceptable. It baffles me why they don\u2019t simply let some of you go so that there\u2019s money available for my research.", "Leonard: You know what baffles me, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Based on your academic record, any number of things, I would imagine.", "Leslie: Hey, guys.", "Leonard: Hey, Leslie.", "Howard: Hey.", "Leslie: Howard, I got the approval for the rapid prototyper you wanted.", "Howard: That\u2019s great, Leslie. Thanks.", "Leslie: You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Rawr.", "Raj: What was all that about?", "Howard: Oh, uh, no big deal. They gave Leslie control of some unrestricted grant money.", "Leonard: Yeah, okay, but what\u2019s with the back-scratching and the meow!", "Sheldon: I believe the back-scratching metaphor generally describes a quid pro quo situation where one party provides goods or services to the second party in compensation for a similar action.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Sheldon: The mrow, that sounded to me like an African civet cat.", "Leonard: Are you done?", "Sheldon: No. Despite what the name suggests, the civet cat is not a true cat. Now I\u2019m done.", "Raj: You know what I\u2019m thinking? I\u2019m thinking Howard wasn\u2019t making a back-scratching metaphor. I\u2019m thinking there was some actual scratching involved.", "Leonard: What about it, Howard?", "Howard: Okay, I didn\u2019t want to say anything \u2019cause I know you and Leslie have a little history.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t care about that.", "Howard: Great, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been dying to say something.", "Leonard: You and Leslie?", "Howard: In the paintball shed! Twice!", "Sheldon: Is that why you didn\u2019t cover our escape and let us get cut down like animals?", "Howard: Oh, yeah, sorry about that.", "Sheldon: My good man, dereliction of duty in the face of the enemy is a court-martial offense.", "Howard: Court-martial, schmort-martial, Leslie Winkle is the fifth girl I\u2019ve ever had sex with. I mean, for free.", "Raj: And plus, you got a rapid prototyper. That\u2019s an expensive piece of equipment, dude.", "Leonard: And the rest of us have had our budgets cut to the bone.", "Howard: Okay, one way to look at this is that I\u2019m getting new equipment, and you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s unfair. But a better way to look at this is that I\u2019m getting sex and you\u2019re not, and that\u2019s delightful.", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard is looking at Penny\u2019s laptop.", "Penny: The whole thing froze. I don\u2019t know what happened.", "Leonard: Calm down. We\u2019ll figure it out.", "Penny: How can I calm down? I\u2019m gonna lose my whole shopping cart. That\u2019s three hours of picking out shoes just shot to hell.", "Sheldon: Hello, Penny.", "Penny: Hello, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re in my spot.", "Penny: Are you planning on sitting here?", "Sheldon: No, I\u2019m going to the comic book store.", "Penny: Then what difference does it make?", "Sheldon: What difference does it make?", "Leonard: Here we go.", "Sheldon: That is my spot. In an ever-changing world, it is a single point of consistency. If my life were expressed as a function on a four-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system, that spot at the moment I first sat on it would be zero-zero-zero-zero.", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: Don\u2019t sit in his spot.", "Penny: Fine. (Moves)  Happy?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not unhappy.", "Penny: Boy, I love him, but he is one serious wackadoodle.", "Leonard: Okay, that should do it.", "Penny: Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver.", "Leonard: That\u2019s a lot of shoes you ordered.", "Penny: Yeah, you know the sad thing is, it\u2019s really not. Ooh, is this one of those paintball guns?", "Leonard: Yeah. You ought to come out with us sometime.", "Penny: Oh, no, thanks. I\u2019m from Nebraska. When we shoot things, it\u2019s because we want to eat them or make them leave our boyfriends alone. (Gun goes off and shoots three paint pellets onto Sheldon\u2019s spot.)", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Leslie: Boy, your heart\u2019s racing. I must\u2019ve really gotten you going.", "Howard: Well, it\u2019s partly you, partly my transient idiopathic arrhythmia.", "Leslie: Sexy.", "Howard: Can I assume that you likewise found the experience\u2026", "Leslie: Satisfactory?", "Howard: That wasn\u2019t quite the word I was looking for, but sure, I\u2019ll do this pass-fail.", "Leslie: Hey, are you enjoying that prototyper I got you?", "Howard: Oh, it\u2019s great. Everybody in the Engineering Department is eating their hearts out.", "Leslie: Isn\u2019t it nice when your good fortune makes others miserable?", "Howard: You know, most people don\u2019t get that.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Howard, I\u2019m home!", "Howard: Oh, great.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Book club was cancelled! That thing on Phyllis\u2019s neck opened up again!", "Howard: I\u2019m busy, Ma!", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Too busy to help your mother with her zipper?", "Howard: Don\u2019t come in, Ma!", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Why not?", "Leslie: He\u2019s got company!", "Howard: Oh, there\u2019s the arrhythmia.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Is she Jewish?", "Howard: Are you Jewish?", "Leslie: No.", "Howard: Yes!", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Okay, then you kids have fun! Use protection!", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard is trying to wash the paint off Sheldon\u2019s seat.", "Penny: You think he\u2019ll notice?", "Leonard: There\u2019s a chance.", "Penny: Oh, what are we gonna do?", "Leonard: We? No, no, no, you had your chance to be we for, like, a year and a half now. Right now, you are you, and you are screwed.", "Penny: Why do we have to tell him I did it?", "Leonard: Well, we\u2019re not gonna tell him I did it.", "Penny: Okay, okay, how about this? We tell him somebody broke in.", "Leonard: Just to shoot the couch with a paintball gun?", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry, I buy it. All those people are on drugs.", "Leonard: We could tell him they wanted the couch to stay away from their boyfriend.", "Penny: Okay, fine. Well, what if we just flip it over? There. Looks fine, right?", "Leonard: Mm, butt print. There\u2019s no discernible butt print.", "Penny: Oh, come on. (Sits and wriggles around) There, butt print.", "Leonard: It\u2019s too small and too perfect.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Leonard: You\u2019re welcome.", "Penny (as Sheldon enters): Shh! Act normal.", "Leonard: Sheldon! How was the comic book store?", "Sheldon: Fine. The new issue of Flash is out.", "Leonard: Great, great. Did you walk the whole way? It\u2019s a little chilly.", "Sheldon: Koothrappali picked me up.", "Leonard: Isn\u2019t that terrific? He is such a good friend. You know what the best thing about friends is?", "Sheldon: They don\u2019t talk incessantly for no particular reason.", "Leonard: No, no, friends forgive the little things.", "Penny: You know, I gotta go home and wash my hair.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t you dare, missy.", "Sheldon: Hello, fastest man alive. Want to see me read your entire comic book? Want to see it again? Something\u2019s wrong.", "Leonard: What do you mean?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not sure. It doesn\u2019t feel right.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Oh, that. Penny did that.", "Scene: The same. Everyone is eating. Sheldon is perched on the back of Leonard\u2019s chair. He keeps making moaning noises. Saying \u201cExcuse me\u201d he tries moving back to his spot, but the cushion is not there. He tries perching on the arm in various positions.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t you just eat in your desk chair?", "Sheldon: Why don\u2019t I just eat in my desk chair?", "Penny: Here we go.", "Sheldon: That is my desk chair, that is where I work. I don\u2019t eat in my desk chair and I don\u2019t work in my spot. I work in my desk chair and eat in my spot.", "Leonard: Wackadoodle.", "Howard: You know, there\u2019s kind of an obvious solution here. (To Raj) Get up. (Raj does. Howard moves his cushion across to Sheldon\u2019s spot) There. Problem solved. (Raj whispers to him) Nobody cares where you\u2019re going to sit. You\u2019re not crazy.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, but the problem is not solved. If your head had been accidentally amputated, and we transplanted a dog\u2019s head in its place, would that be \u201cproblem solved\u201d?", "Leonard: If it were your head, it would be.", "Penny: Sheldon, I am really, really sorry, but it\u2019s only for a week. Can\u2019t you be a little bit flexible? Yeah, sorry. I didn\u2019t really think that through.", "Sheldon: You claim it\u2019s going to be a week, but I have no faith in your dry cleaner.", "Penny: Why not?", "Sheldon: Did you notice the sign on his counter? He\u2019s not a full-time dry cleaner. He also makes keys.", "Leonard: Oh, for God\u2019s sake, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Focus is important. Was Michael DeBakey a wedding planner in between heart transplants? Did Alexander Fleming moonlight as a hairdresser? \u201cThanks for discovering penicillin, now how about we try a bouffant?\u201d", "Howard (after his phone rings): Ooh, looks like I\u2019m gonna have sex tonight. Hey, baby\u2026", "Penny: His right hand is calling him?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s Leslie Winkle. It\u2019s a long story.", "Howard: I\u2019ll pick you up in ten minutes. Gentlemen, adieu.", "Leonard: I thought we were going to play Halo tonight.", "Howard: What am I supposed to do, Leonard? There\u2019s a woman out there anxious to have sex with me. You understand, right?", "Penny: No. Not at all.", "Howard: Nevertheless, I must depart. By the way, did I tell you? Leslie pulled some strings and got me on the research trip to Geneva to check out the CERN Supercollider.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re not even a physicist.", "Howard: Okay, there are two ways of looking at this\u2026", "Leonard: Get out.", "Howard: Bye.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bedroom.", "Leslie: You\u2019re improving.", "Howard: Thank you. It helps when I get to practice with a real woman.", "Leslie: Hey, listen. Saturday my sister\u2019s getting married. I.. I want you to come with me. It\u2019s black tie.", "Howard: Yeah, gee, I\u2019d really rather not.", "Leslie: Why not?", "Howard: When I go to weddings, it\u2019s to scam on chunky bridesmaids. I don\u2019t know what I would do with a date.", "Leslie: Oh, all right. I understand.", "Howard: Thanks.", "Leslie: Hey, I\u2019m really sorry about that Geneva trip.", "Howard: What about it?", "Leslie: Oh, didn\u2019t you hear? I had to reduce the number of people going, and you didn\u2019t make the cut.", "Howard: When did that happen?", "Leslie: About 12 seconds ago.", "Howard: Well, hold on. Are you saying if I don\u2019t go to the wedding, I can\u2019t go to Geneva?", "Leslie: Actually, I\u2019m trying not to say it.", "Howard: Okay, I\u2019m sorry, but that makes me a little uncomfortable.", "Leslie: How so?", "Howard: Because it\u2019s like you\u2019re controlling me with new equipment and research trips.", "Leslie: Well, if I weren\u2019t controlling you with new equipment and research trips, then I\u2019d be uncomfortable.", "Howard: How so?", "Leslie: \u2018Cause then we\u2019d be in, like, a real relationship with feelings and all that crap.", "Howard: So, bottom line, I\u2019m just a bought-and-paid-for sex toy.", "Leslie: No. No, not at all. You\u2019re also arm candy. So? What do you think?", "Howard: Hey, Ma, you got to rent me a tux!", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Right now? What kind of sex are you having up there?", "Scene: The apartment", "Leonard: Why are you crouching there?", "Sheldon: This is my spot. Where else am I supposed to crouch?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Texas?", "Penny (arriving with cushion): Here you go. Fresh from the cleaners, good as new.", "Leonard: Really? Great. Sheldon, look. Good as new.", "Sheldon: From that key maker, I highly doubt it.", "Penny: Come on, Sheldon. Just give it a try.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: There, nice and comfy cosy. Zero, zero, zero.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s one more zero. You forgot the time parameter.", "Penny: Sit on the damn couch.", "Sheldon: Nope.", "Penny: What do you mean, nope? What\u2019s wrong with it?", "Leonard: Nothing, it\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with him.", "Penny: It\u2019s exactly the same\u2026", "Leonard: Penny, Penny, I think I know what to do. Sheldon, I have some bad news.", "Sheldon: More?", "Leonard: I\u2019m afraid so. You know the cashew chicken I get you Monday nights?", "Sheldon: Yes. From Szechuan Palace.", "Leonard: Szechuan Palace closed two years ago.", "Sheldon: What? Wh-Where did my cashew chicken come from?", "Leonard: Golden Dragon.", "Sheldon: No. No, this isn\u2019t right. Our food always comes in Szechuan Palace containers.", "Leonard: Yeah, well, before they went out of business, I bought 4,000 containers. I keep them in the trunk of my car.", "Sheldon: But. Oh, this changes everything.", "Leonard: I thought that might take his mind off the cushion.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s real? What isn\u2019t? How can I know?", "Penny: You did make that up, right?", "Leonard: Oh, God, I wish I had.", "Sheldon: Leonard?", "Leonard: Yeah, buddy?", "Sheldon: I still don\u2019t like this cushion.", "Scene: The paint ball range.", "Leonard: Okay, first of all, Penny, thank you for coming.", "Penny: Thanks for the shoes.", "Leonard: Penny is an amazing shot. I think we have a real chance to win this week.", "Howard: What\u2019s the plan?", "Leonard: Okay. Now, we all run out. Sheldon and I will cut to the left behind these trees. Raj, Howard and Leslie flank to the right behind the rocks. Then we\u2019ll all have a great view as Penny runs out and kills everyone else in sight.", "Sheldon: Right, just one thing before we start.", "Leonard: What is it, Sheldon? (Sheldon shoots Penny)", "Penny: What the hell?", "Sheldon: That was for my cushion.", "Leonard: Sheldon, Penny was our only hope.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, Leonard. But revenge is a dish best served cold.", "Penny: Screw that. (Shoots Sheldon)", "Sheldon: She can\u2019t shoot me. She\u2019s dead.", "Leonard: He\u2019s right. You can\u2019t. (Shoots Sheldon)", "Sheldon: Well, if we\u2019re going to descend into anarchy (Shoots Leonard)", "Howard: Okay, see you.", "Leonard: Where are you going?", "Leslie: Surrender, then Denny\u2019s."]}
