{"series": "2", "episode": "22", "transcript": ["Scene: The comic book store.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Smell that? That\u2019s the smell of new comic books. Oh, yes!", "Howard: They\u2019re on me today, boys.", "Raj: You\u2019re paying? Have you been selling your sperm again?", "Howard: No, I\u2019m celebrating. As we speak, the space shuttle is docking at the International Space Station where it will deploy the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Waste Disposal System.", "Raj: Oh, get over yourself, it\u2019s a high-tech toilet.", "Leonard: Just think. Thanks to your hard work, an international crew of astronauts will boldly go", "where no man has gone before.", "Howard: Is that supposed to be funny?", "Sheldon: I believe it is. The combination of the Star Trek reference and the play on words involving the double-meaning of the verb to go suggests that Leonard is humorously mocking your efforts in space plumbing.", "Howard: Okay, make your little jokes, but of the four of us, I\u2019m the only one making any real-world contribution to science and technology.", "Raj: He\u2019s right. This is an important achievement, for two reasons. Number one, and, of course, number two.", "Sheldon: Oh, clever! Playing on the use of cardinal numbers as euphemisms for bodily functions.", "Stuart: Here, Sheldon, I pulled the new Hellboy for you. It\u2019s mind-blowing.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, spoiler alert.", "Stuart: I didn\u2019t spoil anything.", "Sheldon: You told me it\u2019s mind-blowing, so, my mind is going into it pre-blown. And once a mind is pre-blown, it cannot be re-blown.", "Stuart: I\u2019m sorry.", "Sheldon: Said the Grinch to Christmas.", "Stuart: Uh, hey, Leonard, can I talk to you about something?", "Leonard: Oh, sure, what\u2019s up?", "Stuart: Remember I went out with your friend Penny a couple weeks ago?", "Leonard: Yeah, vaguely.", "Raj: Sure you remember. You went to the bar and made a fool of yourself trying to pick up strange women.", "Leonard: What about it?", "Stuart: Well, uh, the thing is, the date didn\u2019t go that well.", "Leonard: Oh, too bad. I guess the thing to do now is just pick yourself up, dust yourself off, forget it and move on.", "Stuart: I can\u2019t do that.", "Leonard: Why the hell not?", "Stuart: \u2018Cause we\u2019re going out again tomorrow.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, Stuart. Have you read the new Flash?", "Stuart: No.", "Sheldon: Well, I have and it will knock your socks off! Good luck getting them back on.", "Stuart: Uh, anyway, I figured this is probably my last shot with Penny and I don\u2019t want to screw it up.", "Leonard: Nobody wants that.", "Stuart: So, here\u2019s my question. It\u2019s the second date, you think she\u2019ll be expecting things to get physical?", "Leonard: Uh, oh, gee, my initial reaction is no. You know, let me think about it and get back to you, okay?", "Stuart: Okay, so, you\u2019ll give me a call?", "Leonard: Yeah, or you call me.", "Stuart: Great.", "Leonard: Or nobody calls anyone.", "Raj: Interesting. Penny\u2019s current suitor asking advice from her former suitor.", "Leonard: You know, thanks for closed-captioning my pain, Raj.", "Howard: Hey, wanna make sure he gets nowhere with Penny without jeopardizing your friendship with either of them?", "Leonard: I\u2019m listening.", "Howard: Just tell him to do everything you\u2019ve done with her for the last two years.", "Credits sequence.", "\u00a0", "Scene: The lobby.", "Penny: Hey, Leonard.", "Leonard: Oh, hi.", "Penny: How\u2019s it going?", "Leonard: Good, good. You?", "Penny: Fine. Oh, hey, can I ask you something?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Penny: You know your friend Stuart?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Penny: Well, he asked me out again and I said yes, and then I started thinking maybe I should talk to you first.", "Leonard: About what?", "Penny: Well, does it bother you, me going out with one of your friends? \u2018Cause you know, you and me\u2026", "Leonard: No, no that\u2019s the past. I\u2019m really more of a right now kind of guy. You know, living in the moment. Although I do have to live a little in the future, \u2019cause, well, that\u2019s my job. Of course, my fondness for classic science fiction does draw my attention backwards, but those stories often take place in the future. In conclusion, no, it doesn\u2019t bother me.", "Penny: Okay, well, that\u2019s really cool of you.", "Leonard: Yeah, well I wouldn\u2019t say cool, I\u2019d just say, that\u2019s Leonard!", "Penny: Well, In that case, do you mind giving me some advice?", "Leonard: About Stuart? Love to.", "Penny: He\u2019s very shy, how do I make him feel more comfortable around me?", "Leonard: Well, uh, first of all, don\u2019t underestimate the value of discomfort.", "Penny: Really?", "Leonard: Well, yeah, Stuart thrives under pressure, that\u2019s why he works in a comic book store.", "Scene: The university cafeteria. Leonard\u2019s phone rings. ", "Leonard: Oh. It\u2019s Stuart.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re not going to answer it?", "Leonard: He wants to talk about Penny. I don\u2019t want to talk about Penny.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re making an assumption. Perhaps the comic book store is on fire, and he needs your assistance.", "Leonard: Why would he call me?", "Sheldon: We don\u2019t know. And if you don\u2019t answer the phone, we can\u2019t know.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not answering the phone, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Answer the phone, Leonard.", "Leonard: No! There, it went to voice mail.", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to check your messages?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: You have to check your messages, the leaving of a message is one half of a social contract which is completed by the checking of the message. If that contract breaks down then all social contracts break down and we descend into anarchy.", "Leonard: It must be hell inside your head.", "Sheldon: At times.", "Howard: Guys, we have a code red.", "Sheldon: Do you mean code red the hospital emergency alert, code red the computer worm, or code red the cherry flavoured soft drink from the makers of Mountain Dew?", "Howard: Look, I was going over the schematics on my zero-G toilet, and I made a teeny tiny mistake on the specifications for the diverter valve.", "Leonard: How teeny tiny?", "Howard: It\u2019s gonna fail after about ten flushes.", "Sheldon: But the mission is for six months.", "Howard: Yeah, see, that\u2019s the code red. It\u2019s kind of like a jack-in-the-box, no one knows exactly when, but at some point something way worse than a puppet is gonna pop out of that box.", "Sheldon: Have you notified NASA?", "Howard: No. Are you crazy?What am I gonna say? I screwed up your toilet and pretty soon there\u2019s gonna be crap floating all over your nice shiny space station?", "Leonard: Well, what are you gonna do?", "Howard: I\u2019m gonna figure out how to fix it, then I\u2019ll tell them.", "Leonard: So, what do you need us for?", "Raj: He can\u2019t figure out how to fix it.", "Howard: Hey, you said you were gonna be supportive.", "Raj: I\u2019m trying, but you have to admit this is pretty damn funny.", "Sheldon: I agree. It\u2019s the juxtaposition of the high-tech nature of space exploration against the banality of a malfunctioning toilet that provides the comic fodder here. Check your messages.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: All right, this is an exact duplicate of the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Disposal System as deployed on the International Space Station.", "Raj: Don\u2019t you mean the Wolowitz Zero-Gravity Human Waste Distribution System?", "Leonard: Good one.", "Raj: Yeah.", "Howard: Yeah, ha, it\u2019s hilarious. Now, here\u2019s an approximation of the spare parts available on the Space Station. We gotta find a way, using nothing but this, to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine.", "Raj: You mean so it doesn\u2019t hit the fan?", "Sheldon: Yeah, I have to say, I thought the toilet humour would get less funny with repetition. Apparently, there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop. (There is a knock on the door)", "Stuart: Hey Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey Stuart.", "Stuart: You busy?", "Leonard: Um\u2026", "Howard: Classified, Leonard.", "Leonard: Yeah, it\u2019s a regular Manhattan Project. What\u2019s up?", "Stuart: Well, tonight\u2019s my date with Penny and since we haven\u2019t been able to connect by phone\u2026", "Leonard: Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s been broken.", "Stuart: Or e-mail.", "Leonard: Yeah, that too. Everything\u2019s broken.", "Stuart: Anyway, I was just wondering if you had any last-minute advice.", "Leonard: All right, well, off the top of my head, I think the most important thing with Penny is to go really slow. I mean, glacial.", "Stuart: Okay.", "Leonard: You know, guys come onto her all the time, so, you need to, like, set yourself apart. You know, be a little shy, don\u2019t make too much eye contact. And, you know, treat her with, like, cool detachment and, and, and, you know, fear.", "Stuart: Fear?", "Leonard: Yeah, like, you\u2019re afraid that if you touch her, she\u2019ll break.", "Stuart: Well, that plays right into my wheelhouse.", "Leonard: Good, good. Well, you kids have fun tonight.", "Stuart: Thanks, Leonard. What is that thing anyway?", "Howard: You don\u2019t know what this is?", "Stuart: No.", "Howard: Good. Get out.", "Raj: Be afraid of Penny, nice, very crafty.", "Leonard: It wasn\u2019t bad advice. It just wasn\u2019t particularly helpful.", "Sheldon: For what it\u2019s worth, my mother says that when we deceive for personal gain, we make Jesus cry.", "Scene: Later.", "Sheldon: All right, what if we use this two-inch PVC to reinforce the centre cross-support?", "Howard: No good. I mean, it might work for the Japanese and the Americans, but have you seen the size of the Russians they got up there? This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet.", "Leonard: I feel terrible.", "Howard: Maybe if you were helping, you\u2019d feel better about yourself.", "Leonard: I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart\u2019s date with Penny.", "Raj: Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma, dude.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t really believe in that superstition, do you?", "Raj: It\u2019s not superstition. It\u2019s practically Newtonian. For every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. Leonard pretends to be a friend and acts like a two-faced bitch, therefore, he is reborn as a banana slug. It\u2019s actually a very elegant system, you know, what goes around comes around.", "Howard: Speaking of what goes around comes around\u2026", "Raj: Okay, look. Instead of trying to reinforce this structure here, what if we just ran another line, bypass it entirely?", "Sheldon: It won\u2019t work. The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.", "Raj: What if we reposition the collection tank?", "Sheldon: It won\u2019t work. No way to mount it.", "Howard: Okay, here\u2019s an idea. What if I change my name and go live with my cousin and her husband Avi in Israel?", "Sheldon: That could work.", "Scene: Outside Penny\u2019s door. Leonard knocks, Penny answers in her dressing gown.", "Leonard: Morning.", "Penny: Morning. What\u2019s up?", "Leonard: Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter trying to fix a zero-gravity\u2026 pasta maker. I\u2019m gonna make a coffee run. Do you want any?", "Penny: Oh, no, thanks. I have coffee.", "Leonard: Great. So how\u2019d it go with Stuart last night?", "Penny: I really don\u2019t want to talk about it.", "Leonard: Yeah. Right. Sure. The thing is, before you guys went out, I spoke to him and\u2026", "Penny: I said I don\u2019t want to talk about it.", "Leonard: Okay\u2026 I just\u2026 I kind of\u2026", "Penny: Look, Leonard, what goes on between me and Stuart is none of your business. So just leave it alone, okay?", "Raj: If you really want to clean up your karma, go get my freakin\u2019 latte.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Howard: Hang on, I think I\u2019ve got this. Help me see if we can wedge this little piece of PVC behind the support rod.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re overestimating the tensile strength of the substructure you\u2019re building.", "Howard: Sheldon, I know what I\u2019m doing.", "Sheldon: If you knew what you were doing, there wouldn\u2019t be a space toilet where my coffee table should be.", "Raj: Howard, wait. Why don\u2019t you use this instead of the PVC to keep the transverse filter assembly in place?", "Howard: Because this is not a spare part from the space station. This is the thing from the pizza box that keeps the lid from touching the cheese.", "Raj: That what that\u2019s for? In India, the lid just touches the cheese. Of course, we also have rampant poverty and periodic outbreaks of cholera, so a little cardboard in our cheese is no biggie.", "Howard: Where are you going?", "Leonard: Comic book store.", "Sheldon: Oh, an excellent idea! I could certainly use a break.", "Raj: Me, too.", "Howard: Hold on, you can go to the comic book store when man can once again safely poop in space.", "Sheldon: Why does Leonard get to go?", "Leonard: \u2018Cause he\u2019s upset over his situation with Penny and if I have to hear about it again, I\u2019m going to kick him in his ovaries.", "Leonard: Thanks for understanding, Howard.", "Howard: I got your back, sister. All right, I think we\u2019ve got a prototype ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.", "Raj: Wow, that\u2019s heavy.", "Howard: Damn right it\u2019s heavy, it\u2019s my mother\u2019s meat loaf, it\u2019s been testing toilets for generations.", "Sheldon: I must say, Howard, I think a detailed letter to MIT describing your current circumstances might entitle you to a refund on your master\u2019s degree.", "Howard: Okay, simulated zero-gravity human waste disposal test with meat loaf analog in three, two, one. (Switches flush. Meatloaf hits ceiling.)", "Sheldon: Fascinating.", "Raj: What do you think the problem is?", "Howard: Not enough bread crumbs.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Leonard: Hey, Stuart, I need to talk to you.", "Stuart: Sure, what\u2019s up?", "Leonard: I think I gave you bad advice about Penny, and I want to apologize.", "Stuart: No, your advice was great.", "Leonard: It was?", "Stuart: Yeah, going slow really worked.", "Leonard: You\u2019re kidding. Never worked for me.", "Stuart: Yeah, last night at dinner, I did what you told me, I went really slow, I kept my distance, and two bottles of wine later, we were making out in my car.", "Leonard: Wine? I didn\u2019t say to give her wine.", "Stuart: It doesn\u2019t matter, that\u2019s where it all went to hell.", "Leonard: During the kissing? What did you do, sneeze in her mouth? I did that to a girl once.", "Stuart: No, everything was good and really hot, and I said \u201cOh, Penny,\u201d and right where she was supposed to say, \u201cOh, Stuart,\u201d she said\u2026 your name.", "Leonard: Leonard?", "Stuart: That is your name, right?", "Leonard: Yeah, no, yeah, wow, I\u2019m sorry. That must\u2019ve been the last thing you wanted to hear.", "Stuart: Well, it beats you know I\u2019m a dude, right? Yeah, it was pretty bad.", "Leonard: No doubt, no doubt. Okay, well, I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out.", "Stuart: Not your fault.", "Leonard: Yeah, how about that? See you soon.", "Stuart: Yeah, sure.", "Scene: The apartment. Howard is on the phone.", "\u00a0", "Howard: Yes, sir, I understand classified. We\u2019ll keep it all classified, no one has to know but you and me.", "Penny: What\u2019s classified?", "Leonard: Howard\u2019s space toilet. I\u2019ll tell you later.", "Howard: Well, they\u2019ve deployed our solution. Let\u2019s just all hope it works.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t see why I have to worry. My career\u2019s not hanging in the balance. That was a joke. It\u2019s funny, because it\u2019s true.", "Penny: Leonard, could you pass the soy sauce, please?", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, were you talking to me?", "Penny: Yeah, I said Leonard.", "Leonard: Yes, you did, didn\u2019t you?", "Penny: What the hell is that?", "Howard: Meatloaf.", "Leonard: What was it doing on the ceiling?", "Howard: That\u2019s classified.", "Scene: The International Space Station.", "Voice: Houston, International Space Station. We have a little situation up here. We\u2019d like to make an unscheduled space walk.", "Houston: ISS, Houston. Which crew members would be involved in this E.V.A.?", "ISS voice: Houston, we\u2019d all like to step outside for a few minutes.", "Houston: ISS, I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t authorize that.", "ISS voice: Uh, Houston, this is more of an FYI call. We are basically out the door."]}
