{"series": "2", "episode": "03", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the sofa, using his laptop. He is wearing a headset.", "Sheldon: Fellow warriors, this is Sheldor the Conqueror. We are about to enter Axel\u2019s fortress. Now this is a long run, so let\u2019s do another bladder check. Alright Barry, we\u2019ll wait for you again, but you really should see a doctor. (There is banging at the door.) Sheldor is AFK. (Goes out to find Penny having trouble getting into her apartment.) Penny, are you experiencing some sort of difficulty?", "Penny: Yes, I can\u2019t get my stupid door open.", "Sheldon: You appear to have put your car key in the door lock, are you aware of that?", "Penny: Yeah!", "Sheldon: Alright then. (Turns to return inside. One of the grocery bags Penny is holding falls to the floor spilling groceries.) ", "Penny: Dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit, dammit.", "Sheldon: Would it be possible for you to do this a little more quietly?", "Penny: I can\u2019t get the damned key out.", "Sheldon: Well that\u2019s not surprising. That Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional edge mounted cylinders, whereas the key for your Volkswagon uses a centre cylinder system.", "Penny: Thankyou, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Point of inquiry, why did you put your car key in the door lock?", "Penny: Why? I\u2019ll tell you why. Because today I had an audition, it took me two hours to get there, I waited an hour for my turn, and before I could even start they told me I looked too Midwest for the part. Too Midwest? What the hell does that even mean?", "Sheldon: Well, the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples who, well they have a characteristic facial bone structure\u2026.", "Penny: I know what it means, Sheldon! God, you know, I have been in L.A. for almost two years now, and I haven\u2019t got a single acting job, I have accomplished nothing, haven\u2019t gotten a raise at work, haven\u2019t even had sex in six months, and just now when I was walking up those stairs a fly flew in my mouth and I ate it.", "Sheldon: Well, actually, insects are a dietary staple in many cultures, they\u2019re almost pure protein.", "Penny (picking up the bag she has just repacked, whereupon the bottom falls out and the groceries fall to the floor again): Oh, sonofabitch!", "Sheldon: I believe the condensation on your frozen foods weakened the structural integrity of the bag. But returning to your key conundrum, perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you.", "Penny: I did, and he said he\u2019ll get here when he gets here.", "Sheldon: And you\u2019re frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology?", "Penny: No! I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly. (Bursts into tears.)", "Sheldon: There there. (Reluctantly) Would you prefer to wait in our apartment?", "Penny: No Sheldon, I\u2019d rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three year-old.", "Sheldon: Alright then. (Turns to go inside again.) ", "Penny: For God\u2019s sake! (Stomps into apartment.)", "Sheldon: Just when I think I\u2019ve gotten the hang of sarcasm.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Inside the apartment.", "Sheldon: Make yourself comfortable. (Sits in Sheldon\u2019s place.) Not there. (Sits on other end of sofa. Puts feet on table. Sheldon looks disapprovingly. Removes feet from table. Sheldon sits and replaces headset.) Sheldor is back online.", "Penny: Sheldor?", "Sheldon: The Conqueror.", "Penny: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: AFK. I\u2019m playing Age of Conan, an online multiplayer game set in the universe of Robert E. Howard\u2019s Conan the Barbarian.", "Penny: Oh.", "Sheldon: Sheldor, back online.", "Penny: What\u2019s AFK?", "Sheldon: AFK. Away from keyboard.", "Penny: OIC.", "Sheldon: What does that stand for?", "Penny: Oh, I see?", "Sheldon: Yes, but what does it stand for?", "Scene: The stairwell. Leonard arrives and sees the spilled groceries. A cat is lapping at a spilled pot of ice-cream. Cut to inside. Penny now has the laptop, Sheldon is instructing her.", "Sheldon: Now just click on the enchanted boots to put them on.", "Penny: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Can I see them in another colour?", "Sheldon: Just click on them. Congratulations, you are now a level three warrior.", "Leonard: What\u2019s going on?", "Penny: Leonard, guess what, I\u2019m a level three warrior.", "Leonard: Great, you know there are groceries outside of your apartment?", "Penny: Yeah yeah yeah, shhh!", "Leonard: I only bring it up because your ice-cream is melting and it\u2019s starting to attract wildlife.", "Penny: Uh-huh, yeah, do I stay in the jungle or go towards the beach?", "Sheldon: It doesn\u2019t matter, right now you\u2019re looking for treasure.", "Penny: Okay. (Leonard motions for Sheldon to talk in the kitchen.) Wait, wait, where are you going?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re okay, if you run into crocodiles just kick them with your boots.", "Leonard: Want to catch me up?", "Sheldon: Well let\u2019s see, uh, she attempted to open her apartment with her car key, because her face is overly Midwestern, um, she hasn\u2019t had sex in six months, and she ate a fly.", "Leonard: Uh-huh. Seriously, six months?", "Penny: Oh my God, a treasure chest, I\u2019m rich!", "Sheldon: Level three and she thinks she\u2019s rich! What a noob.", "Scene: The apartment. Raj is pouring a white liquid into the main dish of a stereo speaker covered in cling film.", "Raj: Okay, we\u2019re all set.", "Howard: Let her rip.", "(Leonard turns on stereo with a remote. Rhythmic bass-heavy music plays. The liquid begins dancing on the speaker.) ", "Penny (entering, carrying a laptop): Hi!", "Leonard: Hey, check it out, it\u2019s just corn starch and water.", "Sheldon: They make up a non-Newtonian fluid which is liquid, but solid under the percussive action of the speaker.", "Howard: That\u2019s what makes it get all funky.", "Penny: Yeah, okay. Listen, I need to talk to Sheldon.", "Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): No, that\u2019s what she said, Sheldon.", "Penny: Okay, look, I bought the game, and I\u2019ve been exploring the Island of Tordage but I can\u2019t figure out how to get past the guard captain.", "Sheldon: Do you have the enchanted sword?", "Penny: No, no, I\u2019ve a bronze dagger.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t slay the guard captain with a bronze dagger, my Lord it\u2019s like the car key in your apartment door all over again.", "Penny: Alright, alright, how do I get the sword?", "Sheldon: Well, have you been to the Temple of Mithra?", "Penny: Is that the place on the hill with the weird priests in front of it?", "Sheldon: No, no, no, it\u2019s\u2026 oh for God\u2019s sakes, gimme. (Takes laptop.)", "Penny: Thank you, I really appreciate this.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re going to have to learn to do these things for yourself, Penny.", "Penny: Don\u2019t patronise me, just get the sword.", "Howard: What the frak?", "Leonard: Beats me. They were playing all last night too.", "Raj: It\u2019s like some kind of weird comic book crossover.", "Howard: Like if Hulk were dating Peppermint Patty.", "Raj: I always thought Peppermint Patty was a lesbian?", "Leonard: No, that\u2019s Marcie. Peppermint Patty\u2019s just athletic.", "Sheldon: There you go, one enchanted sword.", "Penny: Right, gimme, gimme, gimme, I want to kill the guard captain. (Leaves).", "Sheldon: That girl needs to get a life.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. There is a knock on the door. Penny enters.", "Penny (whispering): Sheldon. (Sing-song) Shel-don.", "Sheldon: Danger, danger.", "Penny: No danger, look, it\u2019s just me, Penny, look, I got to level 25 and reached Purple Lotus Swamp, right?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re in my bedroom.", "Penny: Yeah. Leonard gave me an emergency key.", "Sheldon: People can\u2019t be in my bedroom.", "Penny: Okay, well can we go talk in the living room?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not wearing pyjama bottoms.", "Penny: Why not?", "Sheldon: I spilled grape juice.", "Penny: Well, wear different pyjamas.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t wear different pyjamas, these are my Monday pyjamas. Penny, people cannot be in my bedroom.", "Penny: Okay, just tell me, is it too soon to join a quest to the Black Castle?", "Sheldon: You were invited on a quest to the Black Castle?", "Penny: Yeah, yeah, by some guys in Budapest, I\u2019m just not sure it\u2019s the right move for my character.", "Sheldon: Of course it\u2019s not, you\u2019re only a level 25, the Hungarians are just using you for dragon fodder.", "Penny: Really? Boy, you\u2019d think you could trust a horde of Hungarian barbarians.", "Cut to Leonard, exiting his bedroom.", "Sheldon (off): Please Penny, enough, I have to sleep.", "Penny (off): Okay, well you were great, thanks. (Comes out door) Oh, hey Leonard, listen, don\u2019t got in Sheldon\u2019s room, he\u2019s not wearing bottoms.", "Leonard (knocking on door): Sheldon, you want to catch me up again?", "Scene: Dr Gablehauser\u2019s office. Sheldon and Leslie are standing across the desk. ", "Gablehauser: People, I am very busy today.", "Sheldon: I realise that Dr Gablehauser but it is your job, as head of the department, to mediate all inter-departmental disputes. University policy manual chapter four, subsection two, mediation of inter-departmental disputes.", "Gablehauser: Fine. Dr Winkle, what colourful name did you call Dr Cooper this time?", "Leslie: Dr Dumbass.", "Gablehauser: Dr Cooper, Dr Winkle apologises.", "Sheldon: No she doesn\u2019t.", "Leslie: No I don\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Here\u2019s the problem. I was clearly signed up to use the mainframe in Buckman 204, and Dr Winkle just wantonly ripped the sign-up sheet off the wall.", "Leslie: It wasn\u2019t even an official sign-up sheet. He printed it himself and he put his name down in every slot for the next six months.", "Sheldon: If it is a crime to ensure that the universities resources are not being squandered chasing sub-atomic wild geese then I plead guilty. (His phone rings.) Oh, Penny!", "Gablehauser: You need to get that Dr Cooper?", "Sheldon: God, no.", "Leslie: Well don\u2019t turn it off, you might miss your call from the Nobel committee letting you know you\u2019ve been nominated as dumbass laureate of the year.", "Sheldon: Oh yeah, well, you wouldn\u2019t even be nominated. Dr Gablehauser, I have a series of important multi-bit calculations and simulations to run. All she\u2019s doing is reducing irrelevant data and making a mock\u2026", "Gablehauser (as phone rings): Excuse me. Gablehauser. (Holding phone out to Sheldon) It\u2019s for you.", "Sheldon: Hello. Penny, this is not a good time. No, I told you, you\u2019re not prepared for the Sanctum of Burning Souls. You need to be in a group of at least five for that quest, and one should be a level 35 healer. Penny, I can\u2019t log on and help you. We\u2019ll talk when I get home. (Puts phone down) I\u2019m not getting the computing time, am I?", "Leslie: Dumbass.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon enters.", "Sheldon: Leonard, you have to do something about Penny. She is interfering with my sleep, she\u2019s interfering with my work, and if I had another significant aspect of my life, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be interfering with that too.", "Leonard: Why should I do something, you\u2019re the one who introduced her to online gaming.", "Sheldon: Well, yes, but you\u2019re the one who said hello to her when she moved in. If you\u2019d simply restrained yourself none of this would be happening.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t you just tell her to leave you alone.", "Sheldon: I did. I told her, I texted her, I sent out a very emphatic twitter. I even changed my facebook status to Sheldon Cooper wishes Penny would leave him alone. I don\u2019t know what else to do.", "Leonard: Well, what am I supposed to do?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know, but if you don\u2019t figure something out, I warn you I shall become very difficult to live with.", "Leonard: You mean, up until now we\u2019ve been experiencing the happy funtime Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll go talk to her.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. She is on her laptop and talking into a headset.", "Penny: No, Fritz, I need you on my flank. No, I don\u2019t know German. Flankenzie, flankenzie!", "Leonard (knocking and entering): Hey Penny.", "Penny: Busy.", "Leonard: Yeah, I see that. Shouldn\u2019t you be at work?", "Penny: I don\u2019t work on Mondays.", "Leonard: It\u2019s Thursday. Listen, Penny.", "Penny: Uh, Queen Penelope AFK. What?", "Leonard: Okay, um, here\u2019s the thing, um, sometimes people, good people, you know, they start playing these games and they find themselves through no fault of their own, you know, kind of, addicted.", "Penny: Yeah, get to the point, I\u2019m about to level up here.", "Leonard: Well, i-i-i-it\u2019s just if a person doesn\u2019t have a sense of achievement in their real life it\u2019s easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they get a false sense of accomplishment.", "Penny: Yeah, jabber jabber jabber, okay boys, Queen Penelope\u2019s back online.", "Leonard: Penny, you\u2019ve got cheetos in your hair.", "Penny (pulling cheeto out of hair): Oh, thanks. (Eats it.)", "Leonard: Wow.", "Scene: Same \u2013 later. Penny is attacking a multi-headed monster with a sword on the screen.A muscular warrior in a cape walks onto the screen.", "Warrior: Hey Penny, it\u2019s me again, Leonard.", "Penny- warrior: Leonard, I said not now.", "Leonard-warrior: Yeah, I know, I\u2019m just a little concerned about you.", "Penny-warrior: I said not now. (Chops off his head.)", "Leonard-warrior\u2019s head: Okay, maybe later.", "Scene: The university lunch room.", "Raj: Hey guys.", "Leonard and Howard: Hey.", "Raj (indicating Sheldon): Hey, what\u2019s with him?", "Leonard: Penny\u2019s been keeping him up at night.", "Howard: Me too. But probably in a different way.", "Leonard: She\u2019s gotten really hooked on Age of Conan, she\u2019s playing non-stop.", "Raj: Ah, yes, online gaming addiction. There\u2019s nothing worse than having that multi-player monkey on your back.", "Leonard: Sheldon, wake up.", "Sheldon: Danger, danger.", "Leslie (arriving): Afternoon men. Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Oh yeah, well your attempt at juvenilizing me by excluding me from the set of adult males\u2026. oh, I\u2019m too tired to do this.", "Leslie: Right, I heard you\u2019ve been pulling all nighters with middle-earth Barbie.", "Sheldon: She comes into my room. No-one\u2019s supposed to be in my room.", "Leslie: Well, I would postulate that she\u2019s escaping into the online world to compensate for her sexual frustration.", "Howard: I do that too. But probably in a different way.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not what she\u2019s doing, Leslie, she\u2019s just trying to shore up her self esteem, it has nothing to do with sex.", "Leslie: Everything has to do with sex.", "Howard: Mmmm, testify. (Puts up hand for a handslap.)", "Leslie: I\u2019m not touching that.", "Leonard: Leslie, you are way off base here.", "Sheldon: Hang on, Leonard, while I have no respect for Leslie as a scientist, or a human being for that matter, we have to concede her undeniable expertise in the interrelated fields of promiscuity and general sluttiness.", "Leslie: Thank you. My point is that Tinkerbell just needs to get her some.", "Sheldon: Some what? Oh, yes, some sexual intercourse.", "Howard: I\u2019ll take the bullet.", "Leonard: Excuse me, this whole idea is insane.", "Sheldon: Yeah, yeah, enough debate, I\u2019m going to take action. (Leans over to a good looking man on a nearby table.) Excuse me, are you currently involved in a sexual relationship?", "Man: No.", "Sheldon: Would you like to be?", "Man: Uh, sure, why not?", "Leonard: Sheldon\u2026", "Sheldon: Zip it pip it. Can I have your phone number?", "Man: Uh\u2026 (checks out Sheldon\u2019s package) Yeah, yeah. (Pulls out pen and writes it on Sheldon\u2019s hand.)", "Sheldon: There, problem solved.", "Leslie: Dumbass.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s flat. Penny is on her laptop. Everything around her is littered with empty food packaging and red bull cans. She burps loudly. Sheldon is sitting on the sofa.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m at the gate to the Treasury of the Ancients, I\u2019m going in.", "Sheldon: Stay close to the wall. Avoid the mummies.", "Penny: Got it.", "Sheldon: I must say, you\u2019re playing very well for a woman of 23?", "Penny: 22.", "Sheldon: Right. 22. (Cut to his screen, he is filling in an online dating profile.)", "Penny: Oh, here come the mummies, which spell do I use? The hateful strike, or the frenzy stance?", "Sheldon: What happened to the rest of your group?", "Penny: I dumped them, they\u2019re a bunch of wussies.", "Sheldon: Frenzy stance.", "Penny: Frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy, frenzy!", "Sheldon: So listen, would you describe your ideal vacation as a wild adventure to unknown lands, or staying at home curled up with a good book?", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: These are market research questions. I\u2019m filling out the online registration for your game.", "Penny: Oh, okay, wild adventure. Oh, frenzy stance isn\u2019t working, die you undead mummy, die!", "Sheldon: Drink a healing potion.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re welcome. Anyhow, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being always initiated by him, and 5 being always initiated by you, how do you prefer your sexual encounters to begin?", "Penny: That\u2019s on the registration?", "Sheldon: Oh yes, it\u2019s quite extensive. But if we complete it, we get a free expansion pack, 75 additional quests.", "Penny: Ooh, awesome, okay, I totally like to initiate I\u2019m a big old five.", "Sheldon: Good to know. Big old five.", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard enters. There is a strange man sitting on the sofa.", "Leonard: Hello.", "Man: Hi.", "Sheldon: Leonard, this is Tom.", "Leonard: Hi Tom. Sheldon? Didn\u2019t I explain to you about your little mistake in the cafeteria?", "Sheldon: Yes, you were very clear, as was everyone else at the table. Tom, however, has been chosen by science as a suitable mate for Penny.", "Leonard: Chosen by science?", "Sheldon: Well, what passes for science on dating sites. They claim to use heuristic algorithms, but it may well be hokum.", "Leonard: You got Penny to sign up for online dating?", "Sheldon: No, of course not. No, I used trickery and deceit.", "Leonard: This is bad.", "Sheldon: Tom is a paramedic with the fire department, but he\u2019s going to med school at night, uh, he likes the outdoors, and, uh, strong women who initiate sex.", "Leonard: Really, really bad.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m surprised you struck out with Penny. Apparently she\u2019s a big old five.", "Penny (entering, looking ratty in baggy clothes and with her hair unwashed): Sheldon, what do you want.", "Sheldon: Oh, good, you got my note. Penny, I\u2019d like you to meet Tom, uh, Penny, this is Tom, Tom, may I present Penny.", "Tom: Hi Penny.", "Penny: Yeah, Hi, listen, as long as I\u2019m here, I\u2019m on a quest with a bunch of noobs, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing, we\u2019ve got one assassin, three spellcasters and no tank.", "Sheldon: Can we talk about this later.", "Penny: No, no, no, no, I need you now.", "Sheldon: But wouldn\u2019t you prefer to socialise with Tom, who is a sexually passive outdoorsman.", "Penny: Whatever, I\u2019ll figure it out myself.", "Tom: Bye, Penny. I\u2019m sorry, dude, she didn\u2019t look anything like her picture.", "Leonard: They never do.", "Scene: Inside the game. Penny-warrior is standing next to a battle horse. ", "Warrior: Hello, fair Penny.", "Penny-warrior: Who are you?", "Warrior: It is I, Sir Howard of Wolowitz. Can I interest you in an afternoon of spirited questing, followed by a flagon of ale at yon virtual tavern?", "Penny-warrior: Yeah, sure, why not?", "Penny: Oh my God, I need help. (Closes laptop and throws it away.) "]}
