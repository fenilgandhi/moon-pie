{"series": "2", "episode": "06", "transcript": ["Scene: A lecture room at the university.", "Leonard: So, if any of you are considering going into experimental physics, my door is always open. Once again, I\u2019m sorry that the demonstration didn\u2019t quite work out, but now we know what happens when you accidentally spill peach Snapple into a helium neon laser. Short answer is\u2026 don\u2019t. And now to tell you about the theoretical physics department is Dr. Sheldon Cooper. Dr. Cooper?", "Sheldon (off): Forget it.", "Leonard: Excuse me. Sheldon, we both agreed to do this.", "Sheldon (off): It\u2019s a waste of time. I might as well explain the laws of thermodynamics to a bunch of labradoodles.", "Leonard: If you don\u2019t do this, I won\u2019t take you to the comic book store.", "Sheldon (entering): Hello. Nice work with the laser, by the way. Looking out at your fresh young faces, I remember when I too was deciding my academic future as a lowly graduate student. Of course, I was 14, and I\u2019d already achieved more than most of you could ever hope to, despite my 9 o\u2019clock bedtime. Now, there may be one or two of you in this room who has what it takes to succeed in theoretical physics, although, it\u2019s more likely that you\u2019ll spend your scientific careers teaching fifth graders how to make paper mache volcanoes with baking soda lava.", "Leonard: Oh, good God.", "Sheldon: In short, anyone who told you that you would someday be able to make any significant contribution to physics played a cruel trick on you, a cruel trick indeed. Any questions? Of course not. I weep for the future of science. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, the latest issue of Batman is out. Come, Leonard.", "Leonard: Laser demonstration\u2019s looking pretty good now, huh?", "Credits sequence. ", "\u00a0", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "\u00a0", "Raj: I love this time of the year. The leaves are turning, there\u2019s a bracing chill in the air.", "Howard: Plus there\u2019s a whole new crop of female grad students about to put on just enough winter weight to make them needy and vulnerable. That\u2019s right, honey, have another calzone, Daddy can wait.", "Raj: Isn\u2019t there a university policy against dating graduate students?", "Leonard: No, if you can talk to them, you can ask them out.", "Raj: Damn, there\u2019s always a catch.", "Leslie Winkle (entering): Hey, guys.", "Leonard: Hey, Leslie.", "Leslie: So, dumbass, I heard you made a grad student throw up last night.", "Sheldon: The truth can indeed be a finger down the throat of those unprepared to hear it. But why should I cater to second-rate minds?", "Leslie: Because first-rate minds call you \u201cdumbass\u201d?", "Sheldon: Oh, yeah? Well\u2026 you\u2019re a mean person.", "Girl (arriving): Excuse me, Dr. Cooper, I\u2019m Ramona Nowitzki, I was at your talk last night. I think you\u2019re just brilliant.", "Sheldon: That is the prevailing opinion.", "Leslie: Oh, now I\u2019m gonna throw up.", "Howard: Howard Wolowitz, department of engineering, co-designer of the International Space Station\u2019s Liquid Waste Disposal System.", "Ramona: Ew. Dr. Cooper, I\u2019ve read everything you\u2019ve published. I especially liked your paper on grand unification using string-network condensates and was wondering how you determined that three-dimensional string-nets provided a unified picture of fermions and gauge bosons?", "Sheldon: Amazing, an intelligent labradoodle.", "Howard: Woof.", "Sheldon: The fact is I\u2019m quite close to a breakthrough in showing how neutrinos emerge from a string-net condensate.", "Ramona: Oh, my God, that would change the way we view the entire physical universe.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s what I do.", "Howard: You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz Liquid Waste Disposal System is turning a few heads as well.", "Ramona: Again, ew. You know, I\u2019d love to hear more about how you intend to add neutrinos. Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t drink coffee.", "Howard: I do. I love me a cup of joe.", "Ramona: Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be coffee. How about dinner?", "Sheldon: I do eat dinner.", "Ramona: Great. I know a terrific little Italian place.", "Sheldon: I never eat in strange restaurants. One runs the risk of non-standard cutlery.", "Ramona: Excuse me?", "Leonard: Sheldon lives in fear of the three-tined fork.", "Sheldon: Three tines is not a fork, three tines is a trident. Forks are for eating, tridents are for ruling the seven seas.", "Ramona: What if I brought food to your place?", "Sheldon: That would be acceptable. On Mondays, I eat Thai food. Mee krob and chicken sate with extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.", "Ramona: You got it. I already have your address.", "Sheldon: What a nice girl.", "Howard: Sheldon, do you have any idea what just happened?", "Sheldon: Yes. Apparently I\u2019m getting a free dinner.", "Scene: The apartment building lobby. Ramona is waiting by the lift. Penny enters.

Guess I\u2019m taking the stairs.", "Penny: Where you going?", "Ramona: 4-A.", "Penny: Oh, are you here to see Leonard?", "Ramona: No, Dr. Cooper.", "Penny: Dr. Sheldon Cooper?", "Ramona: We\u2019re having dinner.", "Penny: Sheldon Cooper? Tall, thin, looks a little like a giant praying mantis?", "Ramona: He is cute, isn\u2019t he?", "Penny: Sheldon Cooper?", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard opens the door, Ramona and Penny are outside. ", "\u00a0", "Ramona: Hi, Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey, Ramona. Come on in.", "Ramona: Thanks. Where should I put this?", "Leonard: Uh, the kitchen\u2019s fine. (To Penny) Hey, what are you doing?", "Penny: I need to see this.", "Leonard: Uh-huh. The viewing area\u2019s right over there. Sheldon, your girl\u2026 date\u2026 person\u2026 Ramona\u2019s here.", "Sheldon: Oh, hello.", "Ramona: Oh, sorry I\u2019m late. I just got so caught up reading the draft of your latest paper.", "Sheldon: Did you enjoy the humorous footnote where I illustrate mirror-symmetry by likening it to the Flash playing tennis with himself?", "Ramona: So funny. But the idea that you might be able to incorporate gravity, I have to tell you, I found it physically exhilarating.", "Sheldon: My hypotheses tend to have that effect.", "Ramona: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t bring enough for your friends. I assumed we were going to be alone.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah. No, we were just going.", "Howard: To watch, right?", "Leonard: No, come on, now, we\u2019re going out.", "Penny: Oh, come on, we\u2019ll be quiet.", "Leonard: Let\u2019s go. Okay, you two, just, have a nice\u2026 whatever this is.", "Penny (in hallway): Okay, you guys, look, I know this is none of my business, but I just, I have to ask, what\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s deal?", "Leonard: What do you mean \u201cdeal\u201d?", "Penny: You know, like what\u2019s his deal? Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?", "Leonard: Honestly, we\u2019ve been operating under the assumption that he has no deal.", "Penny: Come on, everybody has a deal.", "Howard: Not Sheldon. Over the years, we\u2019ve formulated many theories about how he might reproduce. I\u2019m an advocate of mytosis.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry?", "Howard: I believe one day Sheldon will eat an enormous amount of Thai food and split into two Sheldons.", "Leonard: On the other hand, I think Sheldon might be the larval form of his species, and someday he\u2019ll spin a cocoon and emerge two months later with moth wings and an exoskeleton.", "Penny: Okay, well, thanks for the nightmares.", "Leonard: Hey, do you want to hang out with us?", "Penny: What are you guys gonna do?", "Leonard: Uh\u2026", "Howard: My mom\u2019s making a brisket tonight.", "Leonard: The one with the little onions? Mmm.", "Penny: Yeah, I\u2019m busy, so, goodnight.", "Howard: Her loss. Let\u2019s go.", "Raj: Brisket party!

She\u2019s smart, insightful and she has a very unique way of, you know, revering me.", "Ramona (arriving): Here\u2019s your spinach mushroom omelette .", "Sheldon: Thank you. Did anyone touch it?", "Ramona: Gloves were worn by everyone involved. I was vigilant.", "Sheldon: Ramona pointed out that I\u2019ve been wasting 20 minutes a day standing on cafeteria lines.", "Ramona: Time which would be better spent tackling the great physics problems of our day.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t tackle the big issues, Ramona. You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.", "Leonard: Touche.", "Leslie (arriving): Morning.", "Leonard: Ah, hey Leslie.", "Leslie: So, Sheldon, I see you\u2019re organizing your papers for the Smithsonian Museum of Dumbassery.", "Ramona: There won\u2019t be any room until they get rid of the permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.", "Sheldon: Oh, good one.", "Leslie: I see you got a grad student to fight your battles for you. I\u2019ll let you keep your lunch money today.", "Ramona: Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge of a breakthrough. If you\u2019re going to stay, you\u2019ll have to be respectful and quiet.

Ramona looks pointedly at Leonard) ", "Leonard: Wait for me.", "Ramona: So have you worked out the neutrino issue?", "Sheldon: Well, to paraphrase Mozart, all the subatomic particles are there, I just have to put them in the right order.", "Ramona: You\u2019re so witty.", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t I?", "Scene: The apartment. There is a knock on the door which then opens and Penny enters.", "Penny: Hey, guys, this package came for y\u2026", "(Sheldon is sitting in his usual seat, typing on his laptop.

What are they doing?", "Penny: You know, the only way I could explain it would be in a therapist\u2019s office with dolls.", "Leonard (enters): Hoo-boy.", "Ramona: Dr. Cooper\u2019s working.", "Leonard: Yeah, I can see that. Sheldon, Halo night, Koothrappali\u2019s. You coming?", "Sheldon: Oh, yes, it\u2019s Halo night. Let me just dry my tootsies.", "Ramona: You\u2019re not going to Halo night.", "Sheldon: Yes, I am.

Sorry, Leonard.", "Leonard: Seriously? You\u2019re not coming?", "Sheldon: You heard her. How can I argue with me?", "Leonard: Okay, well, once again, you guys have a good\u2026 whatever this is.", "Ramona: Dr. Cooper, I have to tell you, your friends are holding you back.", "Sheldon: I prefer to think of it as I\u2019m pulling them forward.", "Ramona: Halo night? A man with your intellectual gifts doesn\u2019t waste an evening playing video games.", "Sheldon: He does on Wednesdays.", "Ramona: Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.", "Sheldon: He does want that. Does a man with my intellectual gifts play paintball on weekends?", "Ramona: What do you think?", "Sheldon: Drat.", "Ramona: Now shall we get back to work?", "Sheldon: I suppose. Battlestar Galactica comes on tonight. (Pause) I guess I can wait for the DVD.

Look, Ramona finally dozed off, and I need you to help me get rid of her.", "Penny: Get rid of her how?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know, but apparently I\u2019m in some kind of relationship, and you seem to be an expert at ending them.", "Penny: Excuse me?", "Sheldon: I see man after man leaving this apartment never to return.", "Penny: Okay, first of all, it is not man after man.", "Ramona (off): Dr. Cooper?!", "Sheldon: Hide me.", "Penny: Hide you?", "Sheldon: I formally request sanctuary.", "Ramona: Why aren\u2019t you working?", "Sheldon: Um\u2026 she distracted me. I told you, Penny, I don\u2019t have time for your nonsense, I have important things to do.", "Penny: Oh, man.", "Ramona: I know what\u2019s going on here.", "Penny: Really? Well, then will you explain it to me?", "Ramona: You\u2019re in love with Dr. Cooper.", "Penny: Uh, yeah, no, that\u2019s not it.", "Ramona: Don\u2019t try to deny it.
