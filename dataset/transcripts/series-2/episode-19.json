Look, guys, for the future, I don\u2019t mind killing the big spiders, but you have to at least try with the little ones.", "Sheldon: Penny, please, we\u2019re facing a far more serious problem than stray arachnids.", "Leonard: Sheldon, it\u2019s not that bad.", "Sheldon: Not bad? It\u2019s horrible. I mean, you hear stories about this sort of thing, but you never think it\u2019ll happen to you.", "Leonard: So they steamed your dumplings, get over it. New topic, please.", "Howard: All right, Penny, let me take this opportunity to point out that you are looking particularly ravishing today.", "Penny: Not with a thousand condoms, Howard.", "Howard: So, there is a number.", "Penny: Okay, new topic, please. Hey, did you hear the people upstairs in 5A are moving out?", "Leonard: Shh-shh-shh!", "Sheldon: What?", "Penny: The people upstairs are moving out.", "Leonard: No!", "Sheldon: The horror!", "Leonard: Why would you just say something like that?", "Sheldon: No, no, no, no, no, no, no\u2026", "Penny: How else was I supposed to say it?", "Leonard: Slowly, like putting a new fish in a tank. You don\u2019t just drop it in, you let the bag sit in the water a while.", "Sheldon: The horror!", "Penny: Sheldon, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be fine.", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s not going to be fine, change is never fine. They say it is, but it\u2019s not.", "Penny: Okay, honey, did you even know the people that are moving out?", "Sheldon: I never met them. That\u2019s what made them perfect, there were no awkward hellos in the halls, there was no clickety-clacking of high heel shoes on hardwood floors, they may as well have been a family of cats just jumping around from drape to drape without that annoying ammonia urine smell.", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m sure the new people will be just as quiet.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t know that. How can you possibly know that?", "Penny: You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t. You know what? Anyone could rent that apartment now, an opera singer, the cast of stomp, yeah, a tap-dancing pirate with a wooden leg.", "Leonard: Why are you making it worse?", "Penny: I tried making it better, he wouldn\u2019t go for it.", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): You\u2019re right, that\u2019s a great idea.", "Leonard: What?", "Howard: I\u2019ll take the apartment upstairs. I can finally get away from my mother, and we can all spend some more time together, if you catch my drift.", "Penny: The horror!", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Outside Howard\u2019s house.", "Sheldon: Hold on. You honestly expect me to believe that social protocol dictates we break our backs helping Wolowitz move, and then he only need buy us a pizza?", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, that really is how it works.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re tricking me. You tell me the truth, what do we get?", "Leonard: Raj, help me out here.", "Raj: You get to choose between a mountain bike or a PS3.", "Sheldon: I knew it! PS3, definitely\u00a0 PS3, who would pick a mountain bike?", "Howard (voice from inside): Enough with the guilt, ma, we\u2019ll still see each other. I\u2019ll come over every night and have dinner with you.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): The hell you will! What am I running here, a fancy restaurant? Does this look like Olive Garden?", "Howard (voice): Okay, I get it, you\u2019re angry. You don\u2019t want to see your little bird leave the nest.", "Howard\u2019s Mother (voice): Little bird? You\u2019re almost 30, fly, for god\u2019s sake!", "Howard (voice): Fine, I\u2019ll stay! You happy, crazy lady? I sure as hell hope so, because you\u2019re ruining my life!", "Leonard (into phone): Hey, Penny, it\u2019s Leonard. Good news, you can take your head out of the oven.", "Sheldon (removing hernia support): I guess I won\u2019t be needing this.", "Scene: The lobby, there are boxes everywhere and removal men are carrying them up the stairs.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, the new ones, they\u2019re here.", "Leonard: Stay calm, we don\u2019t know anything about them yet. What are you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you?", "Leonard: The box says kitchen.", "Sheldon: So? Do cocaine smugglers write cocaine on the box?", "Blonde girl (arriving): Hello?", "Leonard: Hello.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Blonde Girl: Hello.", "Leonard: Hello.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Blonde Girl: I\u2019m Alicia. I\u2019m moving in upstairs.", "Leonard: That is so great. Oh, I\u2019m Leonard, I live downstairs. Upstairs from here, but under you. Not under you per se, but under your apartment.", "Alicia: That\u2019s nice.", "Leonard: Yeah, it is.", "Sheldon: If that concludes your faltering attempt to mate, hello.", "Alicia: Hello.", "Sheldon: Hello. On a scale of one to ten how light of foot would you describe yourself with one being not cat-like at all and ten being freakishly feline?", "Alicia: Freakishly feline?", "Sheldon: Is that your answer or do you not understand the question? We\u2019ll come back to that one.", "Leonard: Sheldon\u2026", "Sheldon: Hang on. Are you now or have you ever been a salsa, Irish folk or break-dancer?", "Alicia: No.", "Leonard: You\u2019re making her uncomfortable.", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Well, if it helps you feel any better you\u2019re doing very well so far. Next question, are you fertile?", "Alicia: What?!", "Sheldon: I\u2019m trying to determine whether crying infants above my head are a possibility.", "Alicia: I have no immediate plans.", "Sheldon: If that changes, let me know. And finally, area rugs, pro or con?", "Alicia: Pro?", "Sheldon: Alicia?", "Alicia: Yes?", "Sheldon: Welcome to the building.", "Scene: The stairs", "Alicia:Thanks so much for helping me, Leonard.", "Leonard: Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to help.", "Penny (exiting apartment): Oh, hey, guys.", "Leonard: Hey, Penny. this is Alicia, our new neighbour.", "Penny: Hi.", "Alicia: Hi.", "Leonard: I\u2019m helping.", "Penny: I can see.", "Sheldon: Alicia\u2019s non-musical, childless and pro-rug. She\u2019s still on probation, of course, but I like her.", "Alicia: Cool t-shirt.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, I don\u2019t usually dress like this. I\u2019m going jogging.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t jog.", "Penny: I can start.", "Sheldon: True, but the more likely explanation for your attire is that you\u2019re out of clean clothes again.", "Penny: Thank you, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re welcome, Penny.", "Alicia: Please, you look cute. I\u2019m dressed like a slob today, too.", "Leonard: I think you look fantastic.", "Alicia: This one\u2019s a player, huh?", "Penny: Oh, yeah, be careful.", "Alicia: Thanks for the warning.", "Penny: Okay.", "Alicia: I\u2019ll see you around.", "Penny: See ya. I\u2019m dressed like a slob today, too.", "Sheldon: Oh, mimicry. I enjoy mimicry. I\u2019ve been working on Admiral Ackbar from Return of the Jedi. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap.\u201d You have to imagine me with a giant squid head. \u201cIt\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap. It\u2019s a trap.\u201d", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is writing on an imaginary board. There is a knock on the door.", "Sheldon: Come.", "Penny (entering): Hey.", "Sheldon: Congratulations, I see you did your laundry.", "Penny: Well, sort of.", "Sheldon: How does one sort of\u2026", "Penny: I bought new clothes, okay? Is Leonard around?", "Sheldon: He\u2019s upstairs at Alicia\u2019s.", "Penny: Oh. all right, that\u2019s cool, no biggie. He said he\u2019d help me set up my printer, but I guess I can wait. What exactly is he doing up there?", "Sheldon: In what I can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me, he is with Wolowitz and Koothrappali setting up her stereo.", "Penny: Oh, they\u2019re all up there, huh? Hmm, typical.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s axiomatically atypical. Up until recently, they did not know Alicia, and had no encounters with her in a previous location. They never went upstairs to visit the former tenants, so your characterization of their behaviour as typical Is demonstrably fallacious.", "Penny: Okay, now I see the giant squid head. (Leaves)", "Sheldon: Oh, great! now, I have to start all over again. (Rubs out imaginary workings)", "Scene: Alicia\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: Yeah, I thought about renting this apartment, but I\u2019m really more of a downtown loft kind of guy.", "Alicia: Cool. so are you in a loft now?", "Howard: Oh, actually I\u2019m, uh, living with a woman in Altadena. Purely platonic, she\u2019s also my maid.", "Alicia: Sounds like a sweet deal.", "Howard: I won\u2019t lie, it\u2019s pretty dope.", "Penny (arriving): Hello?", "Alicia: Oh, hey.", "Penny: Hey, I just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift.", "Alicia: That is so sweet. Come on in, let\u2019s open it.", "Penny: Great.", "Alicia: Nice dress.", "Penny: Oh, this? I\u2019m dressed like a slob today.", "Alicia: The guys have been helping me set up my sound system. I\u2019ve never had such good-looking technical support.", "Howard: Oh, pish-posh. (Raj whispers to him) I don\u2019t know, it means shucks. (Raj whispers again) Shucks means shucks. Let one go once in a while.", "Leonard: Hey, uh, penny, you want to hear something awesome?", "Penny: Yeah.", "Leonard: Alicia is an actress, just like you.", "Penny: That is so awesome.", "Alicia: Well, trying to be, but it\u2019s so hard.", "Penny: Yeah, I know, tell me about it.", "Alicia: I\u2019ve been out here three months, and all I\u2019ve gotten is a couple of national commercials and this recurring thing on a soap.", "Penny: That\u2019s why I work at the Cheesecake Factory, I\u2019m holding out for the right part.", "Leonard: Alicia, what do you want as your default setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?", "Alicia: Whatever you think is best, cutie.", "Leonard: Well, DTS has more low end, so\u2026 okay.", "Penny: Uh, hey, guys, guys, you will really appreciate this, I read the best science joke on the internet. Alicia, you won\u2019t get it, but it\u2019s right up their alley. Anyway, so, this physicist goes into an ice cream parlour every week and orders an ice cream sundae for himself, and then offers one to the empty stool sitting next to him. This goes on for a while until the owner finally asks him what he\u2019s doing. The man says, \u201cwell, I\u2019m a physicist, and quantum mechanics teaches us that it is possible for the matter above this stool to spontaneously turn into a beautiful woman who might accept my offer and fall in love with me.\u201d The owner then says, \u201cwell, lots of single, beautiful women come in here every day, why don\u2019t you buy an ice cream for one of them, and they might fall in love with you?\u201d And the physicist says, \u201cyeah, but what are the odds of that happening?\u201d", "Leonard: It\u2019s a little insulting, don\u2019t you think?", "Penny: How would I know? I\u2019m not even sure I get it.", "Alicia: Hey, Leonard? If you\u2019re done with the DVD player, can you set up my printer?", "Leonard: Uh, yeah, I\u2019d love to.", "Penny: Uh, hey, maybe when you\u2019re done with her printer, you could set up mine. You know, like you promised a week ago.", "Leonard: Yeah, I\u2019ll get to it, don\u2019t nag me.", "Raj (drinking some wine): Hello there", "Scene: The apartment. Penny walks in without knocking and collapses on the sofa.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: Who is it? Oh hello, Penny, it\u2019s open, come in. Sarcasm.", "Penny: Well, they\u2019re all still up there.", "Sheldon: You think I can\u2019t hear them? Listen to that. Stomp, stomp, stomp. That\u2019s Wolowitz in his stacked heels that fool no one.", "Penny: I don\u2019t even know why I care. I don\u2019t care. All right, I cared enough to memorize that stupid joke, but that\u2019s all I care.", "Sheldon: You know, Penny, there\u2019s something that occurs in beehives you might find interesting. Occasionally, a new queen will arrive while the old queen is still in power. When this happens, the old queen must either locate to a new hive or engage in a battle to the death until only one queen remains.", "Penny: What are you saying, that I\u2019m threatened by Alicia? That I\u2019m like the old queen of the hive and it\u2019s just time for me to go?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m just talking about bees. They\u2019re on the discovery channel. What are you talking about?", "Penny: Bees. Aaah! I just got that physicist joke.", "Scene: The apartment.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Gee, Penny, thanks for buying us dinner.", "Howard: Yeah, what\u2019s the occasion?", "Penny: No, no occasion, just felt like getting some Chinese chow for my peeps.", "Sheldon: Did you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced, not shredded?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Even though the menu description specifies shredded?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Brown rice, not white?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: You stop at the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market?", "Penny: Yes", "Sheldon: Good. See how it\u2019s done, Leonard?", "Penny: So, what do we got going on tonight, huh? Playing Halo watching Battlestar, drop some mentos in diet coke?", "Leonard: You want to watch Battlestar?", "Penny: What can I say? I got my geek on, boys.", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): No, no, PMS is different. (There is a knock on the door. Leonard answers it.)", "\u00a0", "Alicia: Oh, thank God you\u2019re home. I need help.", "Leonard: What\u2019s wrong?", "Alicia: I just got a callback to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed.", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019d watch that.", "Alicia: But my car is in the shop, and I have to be at Universal in forty-five minutes.", "Leonard: Okay, well, I\u2019ll take you.", "Alicia: Oh, you\u2019re a lifesaver.", "Howard: I\u2019ll run lines with you in the car.", "Alicia: Great. And afterward, I\u2019ll take you all out for Chinese.", "Penny: Oh, actually, that\u2019s okay. we already have\u2026", "Howard: Yum. Starving.", "Penny: \u2026chinese food right here.", "Sheldon: They\u2019re gone, Penny. They can\u2019t hear you.", "Penny: I cannot believe they\u2019re letting her just use them like that. I mean, anything she wants, they go panting after her like trained dogs. You know that just last week, she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle\u2019s house in Orange County to pick up her TV?", "Sheldon: You once had Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend.", "Penny: Apples and oranges here, Sheldon. I\u2019m telling you, that girl is a user, iceskating through the life on her looks, taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men, getting auditions for stupid network shows. It creams my corn.", "Sheldon: May I interject something here?", "Penny: Please.", "Sheldon: You got the wrong mustard.", "Scene: The laundry room. ", "\u00a0", "Alicia: Hi.", "Penny:", "Alicia: Guess what? I got the part on CSI.", "Penny: Oh boy.", "Alicia: Something wrong?", "Penny: Uh, no. No, no, no, you know, congratulations, I think you\u2019ll make a great hooker.", "Alicia: Thank you. Hey, I got to ask you something, how much do physicists make?", "Penny: Um, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think a lot.", "Alicia: Yeah, that\u2019s what I figured. Well, got to run, the guys promised to set up my satellite dish and paint my bedroom. Yay!", "Penny: Um, hey, hey, can I talk to you about that for a second?", "Alicia: About what?", "Penny: Well, you know, it\u2019s just that Leonard and Howard and Raj, they aren\u2019t like other guys. They\u2019re special.", "Alicia: Okay, they\u2019re special, and?", "Penny: Oh, let\u2019s see, how can I explain this, um, they don\u2019t know how to use their shields.", "Alicia: Shields?", "Penny: Yeah, you know, like in Star Trek, when you\u2019re in battle and you raise the shields? Where the hell did that come from? Anyways, um, you know how guys like this are, so, please don\u2019t take advantage of them.", "Alicia: Who says I\u2019m taking advantage of them?", "Penny: Come on, they\u2019re doing everything for you, because you\u2019re leading them on.", "Alicia: So I let them do stuff for me. They\u2019re happy. I get stuff. Who cares? And how\u2019s it any different from what you do?", "Penny: Excuse me?", "Alicia: I\u2019ve seen you around them. Are you pretending like you don\u2019t do the exact same thing?", "Penny: Okay, lady, you are way out of line.", "Alicia: Oh, I\u2019m out of line?", "Penny: Yeah, you\u2019re out of line.", "Alicia: Well, what are you going to do about it, bitch?", "Scene: Outside the building.", "Raj: I like green lantern, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s pretty lame that He can be defeated by the colour yellow.", "Sheldon: Only the modern green lantern is vulnerable to yellow.", "Leonard: Golden age green lantern was vulnerable to wood.", "Raj: Great, so I can take them both out with a number-two pencil?", "Howard: Oh, my God! Girl fight! (He grabs Leonard)", "Leonard: What are you doing?", "Howard: I know you. you\u2019re stupid enough to break it up.", "Scene: The apartment. Penny has a black eye.", "\u00a0", "Howard: May I say you look very comely tonight?", "Penny: Thank you.", "Howard: You\u2019re right, this filly\u2019s been broken.", "Sheldon (as music comes down through ceiling): You set it on DTS, didn\u2019t you?", "Leonard: I had to, she called me cutie.", "Howard: According to Alicia\u2019s facebook page, she\u2019s hooking up with one of the producers on CSI.", "Penny: Well, dead whore on TV, live one in real life.", "Sheldon: Oh, great now she\u2019s jumping up and down on the bed."]}
