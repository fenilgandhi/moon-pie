That\u2019s where his little nose is.", "Howard: He\u2019s not showing any symptoms. I guess I\u2019ll just go to the emergency room to be safe.", "Bernadette: Howie, this is just your hypochondria.", "Howard: No, when I sat on the mute button and thought I\u2019d gone deaf, that was my hypochondria.", "Bernadette: We\u2019ll find another time to tell him I\u2019m pregnant.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj (voice): I mean, this is the first time I\u2019ve ever broken up with someone.

If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be. However, pain has an evolutionary purpose. It provides information from the environment that, uh, behaviour isn\u2019t good for us.", "Barry: Wike when I feww in wove with that stwipper and bought her a Pwius.", "Amy: I\u2019m just gonna push all the buttons.", "Sheldon: Raj, now, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re suffering.
