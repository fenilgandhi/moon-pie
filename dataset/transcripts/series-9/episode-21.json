{"series": "9", "episode": "21", "transcript": ["Scene: The comic book store. ", "Sheldon: I have a question about Batman. Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat. Man-bat is a part man, part bat hybrid. Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man to fight crime, would he be Man-Batman?", "Leonard: No, he\u2019d be Bat-Man-Bat.", "Raj: But wouldn\u2019t Man-Batman just be a Batman that was bitten by a radioactive man?", "Howard: But Batman is a man. You\u2019re talking about a man who would have the powers of a man. That\u2019s just Man-Man.", "Sheldon: Well, isn\u2019t Man-Man just Man?", "Leonard: But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?", "Raj: Well, that\u2019s just Batman.", "Leonard: No, if a man dresses as a bat, that\u2019s Batman, but if Man-Man dresses as a bat, that\u2019s Batman-Man.", "Howard: So does that answer your question?", "Sheldon: Oh, I haven\u2019t asked it yet.", "Raj (checking text on phone): Oh, that\u2019s Claire. Got to run.", "Leonard: I thought you were back with Emily.", "Raj: Uh, actually I\u2019m seeing both of them.", "Leonard: You mean like through their window from behind a bush?", "Raj: No, I\u2019m actually dating two women. Later.", "Leonard: Really? The guy who for years couldn\u2019t even talk to women is suddenly going out with two of them? How is that possible?", "Howard: I know. Scientists have tried to reproduce it with computational models, but, in each case, the world blows up.", "Leonard: Seriously, that guy\u2019s dating two women?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: What, why did you get a party sub?", "Leonard: People are coming over, it looked fun.", "Sheldon: Well, we\u2019re only watching Game of Thrones. A party sub implies it\u2019s a party.", "Leonard: Your attendance implies it\u2019s not.", "Sheldon: I like a party as much as the next man, as long as the next man doesn\u2019t like a party. Oh, by the way, don\u2019t forget, tomorrow is our quarterly roommate agreement meeting.", "Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, we don\u2019t need a meeting every three months.", "Sheldon: Hmm? Well, it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up at a quarterly roommate agreement meeting. Lucky for you it\u2019s tomorrow.", "Leonard: Oh, you know what? I\u2019m not going.", "Sheldon: Well, you have to go. It\u2019s Penny\u2019s first time leading the Pledge of Allegiance.", "Leonard: This meeting is a waste of time. Whether we make the switch from Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg\u2019s Raisin Bran should not require parliamentary procedure.", "Sheldon: You realize one of them has sugar on the raisins.", "Leonard: You\u2019re the only one who eats them.", "Sheldon: And yet you get to weigh in. Democracy, it\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it?", "Leonard: I\u2019m not going, you can\u2019t make me.", "Sheldon: Well, we\u2019ll just see about that.", "Penny: What is the problem?", "Sheldon: He says he\u2019s not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow.", "Penny: Well, why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?", "Leonard: You have fun. I will not be attending.", "Sheldon: Oh, fine. We don\u2019t have to have a roommate agreement meeting if you don\u2019t want to.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Of course, it will require a vote. Unfortunately, my official gavel is in my bedroom, but luckily, I have my travel gavel.", "Leonard: You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s a motion on the floor, I\u2019m ridiculous. Do we have a second? Hmm? Hmm? There is no second. The motion is denied. Next time, make sure you have the votes first. That was embarrassing.", "Leonard: Can you please talk to him?", "Penny: Well, why are you fighting him on this?", "Leonard: Because I am tired of him always getting his way. We don\u2019t need a stupid meeting. We don\u2019t even need a roommate agreement, and I hope that sandwich does cause a party.", "Penny: Well, I will still come to your meeting.", "Sheldon: Well, I should hope so. Tomorrow\u2019s picture day.", "Leonard: Why are you taking his side?", "Penny: Because it\u2019s important to him, and when we signed the roommate agreement, we made a deal.", "Sheldon: You keep talking like that, you\u2019re gonna make colour guard.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Raj: Man, I\u2019m worn out.", "Howard: I know. Imagine if we were actually moving.", "Raj: No, it\u2019s just, ever since I started dating Claire and Emily at the same time, it\u2019s exhausting.", "Howard: You\u2019re exhausted? Try folding every five pages in a pregnancy book so your wife thinks you read it.", "Raj: But, dude, you\u2019re so lucky. Getting to stay home at night with the woman you love.", "Howard: I guess I am lucky.", "Raj: You are, because dating two women, I mean, I can\u2019t even remember the last time I slept in my own apartment. I wake up and I\u2019m like, am I at Claire\u2019s or am I at Emily\u2019s? Is there a third girl I\u2019ve forgotten about? Like, where am I?", "Bernadette: Hey, Raj.", "Raj: Hey, how\u2019s the mommy-to-be?", "Bernadette: Good. A little tired.", "Raj: I feel you. I\u2019ve been dating multiple women.", "Howard: You sure you don\u2019t want to come watch Game of Thrones with us?", "Bernadette: You guys have fun. I\u2019m just gonna snuggle up in bed with a book.", "Raj: Oh, that sounds great, a bed to yourself. Can\u2019t even remember what that\u2019s like.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?", "Penny: Mm, I think so. Dragons, snow zombies, and all the hot guys are dead.", "Sheldon: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy who had his genitals cut off.", "Penny: Uh-oh, somebody\u2019s still pouting.", "Leonard: Leave me alone.", "Penny: If it\u2019s because you lost a stick, I know where it went.", "Leonard: Not funny.", "Penny: You know you\u2019re gonna make up with him. Can we just skip to that part?", "Leonard: Oh, of course, because I\u2019m the only adult around here.", "Penny: Really? The only adult?", "Leonard: Yeah, that\u2019s right.", "Sheldon: Tonight I\u2019ll be watching a show rated M.A., and that stands for mature audiences, buster.", "Penny: All right, you would think the only adult wouldn\u2019t let something silly ruin our entire night.", "Leonard: And I\u2019d think you\u2019d understand why I\u2019m annoyed.", "Sheldon: All this could be avoided if you\u2019d just come to the meeting.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to.", "Sheldon: Oh, it\u2019s just a meeting. One simple meeting.", "Leonard: Stop saying meeting.", "Sheldon: Meeting, meeting, bo-beeting, banana-fana, fo-feeting, fee-fi mo-meeting.", "Amy: I brought my famous spinach dip.", "Sheldon: Yeah, Amy, just one second. Meeting.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s car.", "Howard: I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m hoping for a boy or a girl. I mean, if it\u2019s a boy, I\u2019m gonna have to teach him to play catch. Which means I\u2019m gonna have to google how to play catch. If it\u2019s a girl, I mean, they\u2019re so innocent and you know how guys are.", "Raj: Totally, guys are the worst. I mean, look at me. I let Emily make me a frittata and I kept the leftovers in Claire\u2019s fridge that night. I\u2019m such a dog.", "Howard: There you go again.", "Raj: I\u2019m sorry, have I been complaining about it too much?", "Howard: Actually, what you\u2019re doing is pretending to complain, but really trying to brag.", "Raj: How could you say that?", "Howard: Oh, I wish could enjoy a cup of tea without a naked girl bouncing up and down on me.", "Raj: I never said that.", "Howard: Don\u2019t you hate it when you can\u2019t remember whose bra it is you found wedged in your couch?", "Raj: Okay, that I said. But that\u2019s a real problem. You give a girl another woman\u2019s bra, and you will not be having sex with her that night. Maybe the other girl, but not her.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: What\u2019s going on with him?", "Penny: Oh, he\u2019s all bent out of shape about having a roommate agreement meeting.", "Sheldon: Apparently, perfect attendance isn\u2019t cool any more.", "Penny: Don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll come around.", "Amy: Well, I get why he\u2019s annoyed.", "Sheldon: Well, then you don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening. See, Leonard refused to participate in a mandatory quarterly roommate agreement meeting. This is what a generation raised on Bart Simpson looks like.", "Leonard: You love The Simpsons.", "Sheldon: I love Lisa Simpson.", "Amy: Well, I know how he feels. I never enjoyed our relationship agreement meetings.", "Sheldon: Wait. You were pretending?", "Amy: Sorry.", "Sheldon: No. I don\u2019t believe you. I could tell.", "Amy: Oh, Sheldon, I never thought re-filing a matter in a standing subcommittee could be so fascinating.", "Sheldon: Hmm, what do you think?", "Penny: You don\u2019t know?", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Raj: Hey, did I say something to upset you?", "Howard: No, I\u2019m fine.", "Raj: Really? Because usually we walk side by side, and I just went up two flights of stairs staring at your bottom.", "Howard: Just drop it.", "Raj: Okay, I think I see what\u2019s happening here. You\u2019re jealous of me.", "Howard: Oh, please. What could you possibly have that I would be jealous of?", "Raj: It\u2019s not what I have, it\u2019s how many people I\u2019m having it with.", "Penny: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019ll watch Game of Thrones over here.", "Sheldon: Gladly.", "Leonard: Oh, good, go. You know, it\u2019ll be nice to watch an episode without someone saying, I read the books, don\u2019t get too fond of this character.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not always because they die. In one case, it\u2019s because they\u2019ve become involved with underground tree people from the dawn of time. Yeah, but I won\u2019t say who it is. It\u2019s Brann.", "Howard: Wait, what is going on?", "Penny: Leonard\u2019s being a jerk, so we\u2019re gonna watch over here.", "Amy: Do you guys want to watch with us?", "Howard: As long as I don\u2019t have to watch with him.", "Raj: Fine, I don\u2019t want to watch with you either. I\u2019ll go over here.", "Howard: Why do you get to pick?", "Raj: Okay, then you go there.", "Howard: Don\u2019t tell me where to go.", "Leonard: Howard, just come in here.", "Penny: Yeah, come on, Raj.", "Raj: Wait, did Amy make her spinach dip?", "Sheldon: She did.", "Howard: And I\u2019m gonna eat it all.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: So what the hell happened?", "Leonard: Oh, I just ran out of patience with Sheldon\u2019s nonsense.", "Howard: Tell me about it. I\u2019ve had it with Raj, too.", "Amy: You know, like women, men have a monthly hormone cycle. Dips in testosterone can cause irritability.", "Howard: Interesting. Maybe my male cycle synced up with Raj\u2019s actual period.", "Leonard: If Sheldon\u2019s testosterone dipped, he\u2019d become a butterfly. (Knock on door) Oh. Maybe someone\u2019s here to apologize.", "Stuart: Hey, Leonard.", "Leonard: Stuart.", "Stuart: Uh, is this not a dress-up party?", "Leonard: No.", "Stuart: Was it ever a dress-up party?", "Leonard: No.", "Stuart: Howard, didn\u2019t you tell me it was a dress-up party?", "Howard: Yeah.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. Knock on door.", "Stuart: I was told this is where to go if I\u2019m mad at Howard.", "Penny: May I take your cloak?", "Stuart: Thanks. This thing kept getting caught in the chain of my bike.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019ll catch you up. Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard, Leonard\u2019s angry at me and Penny, I\u2019m angry at Leonard and Amy, Raj is angry at Howard, and I\u2019m angry at George R.R. Martin \u2019cause there are no new books for me to spoil for Leonard.", "Stuart: So what happened with you and Howard?", "Raj: Says I was talking too much about dating Claire and Emily, and I accused him of being jealous.", "Stuart: I\u2019m jealous. Closest I\u2019ve come to dating two women was that time I dated one woman.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know how you put up with it. He\u2019s impossible. I mean, holding a meeting to decide what breakfast cereal we should buy.", "Howard: Yeah. Cap\u2019n Crunch with Crunch Berries, move on.", "Leonard: Anyway, Amy, thank you for sticking up for me.", "Amy: Oh, I honestly couldn\u2019t care less.", "Leonard: Sorry?", "Amy: Well, I just took your side \u2019cause sometimes I get annoyed at how close Sheldon and Penny are.", "Leonard: Well, they argue all the time. They aren\u2019t that close.", "Amy: Who\u2019s always comforting him when he\u2019s upset?", "Leonard: Penny, but\u2026", "Amy: Who\u2019s the only one who can make him take his medicine when he\u2019s sick?", "Leonard: I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.", "Amy: Okay. And did you know she has him add things to the roommate agreement so she can get her way and not fight with you about it?", "Leonard: Son of a bitch. Why is that funny?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. I like the pain of others.", "Leonard: Oh, well, then you\u2019ll enjoy this. Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.", "Howard: No, she doesn\u2019t.", "Leonard: She defends him all the time.", "Howard: She does not.", "Amy: Who told you to stop making all those Gandhi jokes about him?", "Howard: Well, she did. And human resources.", "Leonard: Who do you think told Koothrappali to go to human resources?", "Howard: Son of a bitch.", "Leonard: You\u2019re, you\u2019re right, it feels good.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: All right, it\u2019s almost game time. Get it? Game of Thrones, game time?", "Stuart: Two women, huh?", "Sheldon (at knock on door): Oh, perhaps it\u2019s Amy coming to her senses.", "Penny: What\u2019s up?", "Leonard: You know, you don\u2019t need to use Sheldon to get your way with me in a dumb roommate agreement.", "Penny: Where\u2019d you get that from?", "Leonard: From Amy.", "Penny: Ugh. Amy, why did you tell him that?", "Amy: Because you were defending Sheldon like you always do.", "Penny: I don\u2019t always defend Sheldon.", "Leonard: Oh, yes, you do. You know you have a weird brother-sister-Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.", "Penny: What about your weird relationship with him?", "Leonard: That\u2019s different. I\u2019m like the little girl in Poltergeist and he\u2019s the creepy thing in the TV.", "Howard: Um, guys? Were there any nuts in that food?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think so. Why?", "Howard: Well just a feeling.", "Scene: A hospital waiting room.", "Leonard: It just said Italian sub. I had no idea mortadella has pistachios in it.", "Sheldon: Interesting fact, in Italian, the morta in mortadella means death.", "Amy: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t say fun fact. I\u2019m not a monster.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s gonna be okay.", "Sheldon: Now it\u2019s a fun fact.", "Stuart: Boy, stuff like this really puts things in perspective.", "Bernadette: Why are you dressed like that?", "Stuart: Oh, uh, Howard thought it\u2019d be funny to tell me it was a costume party.", "Bernadette: That wasn\u2019t nice.", "Stuart: No, but he almost died, so we\u2019re cool.", "Raj: You know, if you think about it, tonight was kind of like a real-life Game of Thrones.", "Amy: How?", "Raj: Well, Howard eating that pistachio was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.", "Penny: Okay, well, that was murder, this was an accident.", "Raj: Okay. But you using Sheldon to do your dirty work is like when Cersei used the King\u2019s Guard to do her bidding.", "Sheldon: Cersei uses her body to manipulate men. Penny just takes me to The LEGO Store.", "Raj: Okay. Oh, how about this? Stuart\u2019s dressed like a brother of the Night\u2019s Watch, and they don\u2019t have sex.", "Penny: There you go.", "Leonard: That\u2019s true.", "Sheldon: Fair enough.", "Howard: Hey.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Bernadette: You all right?", "Howard: I\u2019m fine. Just a little embarrassed I had to be carried down the stairs like a baby. Thanks.", "Leonard: Let\u2019s get out of here.", "Amy: That was scary.", "Sheldon: Well, the important thing is I said that big sandwich would ruin everything, and I was right.", "Scene: The street. ", "Raj (shouting from upstairs window): Hey, Jon Snow. How come your horse has a basket on it?", "Stuart: How come your head has your face on it?", "Sheldon: They don\u2019t wear bicycle helmets in Game of Thrones. You\u2019re thematically inaccurate, but I applaud your commitment to safety.", "Stuart: Don\u2019t you guys have anything better to do?", "Leonard: Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak ride a girl\u2019s bike? Nope.", "Stuart: That\u2019s it, you just lost bathroom privileges at the comic book store. Horse has a basket on it. Stupid\u2026 aaargh!", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: I never got to ask my question about Batman.", "Leonard: What is it?", "Sheldon: If Batman were bitten by a radioactive Man-Bat, and then fought crime disguised as Man-Bat, would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man or simply Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?", "Penny: Is he still wearing the Batman suit under the Man-Bat suit?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll be back."]}
