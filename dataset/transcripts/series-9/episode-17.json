{"series": "9", "episode": "17", "transcript": ["Scene: The stairwell", "Amy: So Sheldon, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been wanting to talk about but I know it\u2019s kind of a touchy subject.", "Leonard: Way to narrow it down to everything.", "Sheldon: What is it?", "Amy: Well, your birthday\u2019s coming up, and you\u2019ve never let us celebrate it, and I was hoping maybe this year we could.", "Sheldon: Oh, I suppose that\u2019s a discussion we could have.", "Amy: Okay, great, I mean, it doesn\u2019t have to be a big party or anything. I was just, where\u2019d he go?", "Penny: W, wait a minute. You mention his birthday and he vanishes?", "Leonard: Well, where\u2019s that information been this whole time?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Well, where is he?", "Amy: Sheldon?", "Leonard: I\u2019ll check his room.", "Sheldon: Surprise.", "Penny: Oh, my God.", "Sheldon: Just one example of how birthdays can be terrible. Now, can we please drop this subject and pick a new one? I suggest how thick can a soup get before it becomes a stew? You know, the answer, it may surprise you.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry I brought it up.", "Penny: Yeah, what is the problem? Is it about getting older?", "Sheldon: Please, look at this porcelain skin. I\u2019m like a human sink.", "Amy: But it\u2019s the one day a year that\u2019s just all about you.", "Leonard: One day. Right.", "Amy: Can you please just tell me why?", "Sheldon: Fine. As you know, I have a twin sister with whom I obviously share a birthday. Every year we\u2019d have a party. No one I invited would ever come, because they didn\u2019t like me.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry.", "Sheldon: Oh, that part wasn\u2019t so bad. I didn\u2019t like them, either. But then I\u2019d inevitably spend the whole day being tortured by my sister\u2019s friends.", "Penny: Oh, poor thing.", "Sheldon: When I was six, they told me Batman was coming to my party. I waited by the door for hours. Closest thing to Batman I saw was when a robin flew into the window.", "Amy: You realize none of those things would happen now?", "Sheldon: I do, but why do you care if I celebrate my birthday at all?", "Amy: Well, you made my last birthday so memorable, I wanted to return the favour.", "Penny: You know, if you had a party now, you have plenty of friends that would love to come.", "Leonard: And we live here, so we have no choice.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Very well. You may celebrate my life by throwing a party with cake, presents and a shower of admiration and love. But then you owe me big-time.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Howard: You have any idea what you\u2019re getting Sheldon for his birthday?", "Raj: He\u2019s been fascinated with dinosaurs lately. Maybe we could get him a fossil.", "Leonard: Well, just don\u2019t get anything Jurassic. He feels like that whole chunk of time has gone Hollywood. Hey, uh, you know, he told a sad story about how his sister tricked him into thinking Batman was coming to his party.", "Howard: That\u2019s funny. Let\u2019s do that.", "Leonard: Maybe we could get Batman to actually show up.", "Raj: You mean, some guy in a lame suit?", "Leonard: Or a real Batman. Hey, Stuart? Didn\u2019t you try to get Adam West to do a signing here once?", "Stuart: Yeah, but there was kind of a scheduling conflict. He, uh, wanted to know when he\u2019d get paid. And I wouldn\u2019t tell him.", "Leonard: Can I get his contact info?", "Stuart: Sure, uh, but just so you know, he\u2019s kind of a diva.", "Leonard: He is?", "Stuart: Oh, yeah. Won\u2019t take the bus. He won\u2019t pack his own lunch. Won\u2019t let you spend the night on his couch.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Okay, so how do you feel about party balloons?", "Sheldon: Uh, Mylar balloons, yes. Latex balloons, no. Water balloons, I will jump off the roof and aim for your car.", "Penny: All right, what about music?", "Sheldon: I enjoy marching bands and Tibetan throat singing.", "Penny: No music it is.", "Bernadette: What kind of cake do you like?", "Sheldon: Well, my favourite is chocolate with strawberry frosting, three layers, and if there\u2019s writing on it, make sure it\u2019s not all caps. I don\u2019t need my dessert yelling at me.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Raj: Hey, so what was Adam West like on the phone?", "Leonard: Uh, nice guy. But it was a little weird to hear Batman say don\u2019t ring the doorbell or my poodles will go crazy.", "Raj: You know, Adam West is my favourite Batman? Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale and Batman from The Lego Movie.", "Howard: Don\u2019t say that to him.", "Raj: What? He beat out George Clooney, and that\u2019s something. Like, I love me some Clooney.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t say that to anyone.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.", "Stuart: Oh, I, I was just glad to be invited. To be honest, I don\u2019t always feel like I\u2019m part of the group.", "Penny: Okay, sweetie, we\u2019re on the clock here. Can you hate yourself and frost at the same time?", "Barry: Hewwo, I hope I\u2019m not too earwy.", "Bernadette: No, no, no. Come on in.", "Barry: And how is the wadiant mommy-to-be?", "Bernadette: Doing great.", "Stuart: You, you\u2019re pregnant?", "Bernadette: Yeah.", "Stuart: Sounds like something a member of the group might know.", "Penny: Yeah, birthday party first. Pity party later.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Leonard: Are you crazy? How can you put Michael Keaton in front of Christian Bale?", "Adam West: Oh, please. Even my poodles know Bale\u2019s overrated.", "Raj: Thank you. That\u2019s why I say Keaton\u2019s number one. He brought a sense of humour to the role.", "Adam: Oh, if you\u2019re gonna factor in a sense of humour, then I should be at the top of the list. It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer, Lego, Bale, and that pretty boy Clooney.", "Howard: Really? You\u2019re ahead of Bale? The man who personified the words, I\u2019m Batman.", "Adam: I never had to say I\u2019m Batman. I showed up, people knew I was Batman. Everywhere I went, on the TV show, mall openings, Julie Newmar\u2019s bungalow.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sold, you\u2019re ahead of Bale.", "Adam: There\u2019s another reason I should be higher on the list. All those other guys had muscles built into their costumes. All I had in my Batsuit was 100%, grade-A West.", "Howard: Can we just all agree we\u2019re worried about Affleck?", "Leonard: Sure.", "Raj: Yeah, of course.", "Adam: What\u2019s an Affleck?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Is there a reason I had to leave my own apartment?", "Amy: Well, I think they just want you to see it for the first time all decorated.", "Sheldon: But who\u2019s gonna tell them they\u2019re doing it wrong?", "Amy: Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll ask you to give a speech, and that\u2019s when you just tear \u2019em a new one. Have to say, you, you do look good in that suit.", "Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.", "Amy: Maybe later I\u2019ll, uh, get to see you in your birthday suit.", "Sheldon: But this is my birthday suit. Are you having a stroke? Because that\u2019s the kind of thing that just ruins a birthday party.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: So, Mother, I\u2019m surprised you came all this way for Sheldon\u2019s birthday.", "Beverley: Oh, I was happy to. He did come to my 60th.", "Leonard: Oh. You had a party for your 60th?", "Beverley: Oh, I wouldn\u2019t call it a party. Just a few close friends. And your sister and brother.", "Penny: You know, to be fair, we did get married in Vegas and didn\u2019t invite her.", "Beverley: And I never did thank you for that, dear.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Amy: Oh. Penny says everyone\u2019s there. Are you ready?", "Sheldon: I am. Oh. Wait.", "Amy: Are you all right?", "Sheldon: No, I just, I got a little light-headed.", "Amy: Oh, do you need a minute?", "Sheldon: No. No, if I can walk past that pet shop with the parrot in the window, I suppose I can do this.", "All: Happy birthday!", "Leonard: Speech! Speech!", "Raj: Come on, Sheldon, say something.", "Sheldon: Uh, um, uh, thank you all so much for coming. Beverly. Wil Wheaton. Adam West, for some reason.", "Leonard: Batman finally came to your party.", "Adam: Happy birthday, Sherman.", "Sheldon: Thank you. This is all so thoughtful. Excuse me.", "Adam: I still get paid, don\u2019t I?", "Scene: A little later.", "Leonard: Okay, I\u2019d better go in there and talk to him.", "Amy: Well, don\u2019t you think I\u2019m the one who should go in?", "Leonard: No offence, but I\u2019ve known the guy a really long time.", "Amy: Well, I\u2019ve, you know, seen him without pants on.", "Leonard: Again, no offence, but so have I.", "Amy: Well, he\u2019s seen me without pants on.", "Leonard: Again, no\u2026", "Penny: Okay, this is ridiculous. (Knocking) Sheldon? Can I come in?", "Sheldon: How do you know I\u2019m not using the facilities?", "Penny: Because you e-mail me your bathroom schedule once a week, even though I\u2019ve clicked unsubscribe, like, a thousand times. So, what\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know. I looked around the room, and I saw all the faces and the presents, and it, it was just too much.", "Penny: I get that. Hey, you want to just bring a few people in here? You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub, Batman on the toilet. It\u2019ll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.", "Sheldon: I know that you worked hard to put this together. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m ruining it.", "Penny: Oh, pl, you\u2019re not ruining it. Look, at some point, Raj will try to get everyone to do the Electric Slide. Now, that will ruin it.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t think I can go back out there.", "Penny: That\u2019s fine. You know, I hate that your sister and her friends used to torture you. But what I hate even more is, if I was there, I would have tortured you, too.", "Sheldon: Based on this pep talk, I\u2019d say you\u2019re still doing it.", "Penny: My point is, there was a time I never would\u2019ve been friends with someone like you, and now you are one of my favourite people. So, if what you need is to spend your birthday in a bathroom, I\u2019m happy to do it with you.", "Sheldon: Well, everyone will think I\u2019m weird.", "Penny: Sweetie, you are weird. Everyone knows you\u2019re weird, but they\u2019re all still here because they care about you so much.", "Barry (knocking): Hewwo. Some of us need to check our hair because we might have a shot with Weonard\u2019s mother.", "Scene: Later. ", "Leslie Winkle: Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Leslie: It\u2019s been a while.", "Leonard: Leslie. I can\u2019t remember the last time we talked. So much has changed.", "Leslie: Has it?", "Leonard: Yeah, uh, um, Penny and I got married.", "Leslie: Wow, congratulations. You know, actually, I thought you\u2019d be living with Sheldon forever.", "Leonard: Yeah, well, don\u2019t be a stranger.", "Penny: Okay, everybody, Sheldon is gonna come back out, but I think he\u2019s a little embarrassed, so let\u2019s all be extra nice, okay?", "Barry: What are you wooking at me for? I\u2019m a saint. But a sinner in the sack.", "Sheldon: Hello, everyone. I, I\u2019d like to apologize for my behaviour. I hope it hasn\u2019t put a damper on the party. So, please, enjoy yourselves. Oh, this is quickly getting out of hand.", "Amy: If I may, I, I\u2019d like to propose a toast. Um, thank you all for coming tonight. I know it\u2019s customary for the birthday boy to receive presents, but I feel like I got the greatest gift the day he was born.", "General cheers.", "Sheldon: Aw, Amy, that was lovely. You know, this is fun. Let\u2019s do more. Someone else say something wonderful about me.", "Howard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t think everyone\u2026", "Sheldon: Wolowitz, perfect. Everyone listen to Wolowitz.", "Howard: Okay, then, uh, Sheldon, we\u2019ve known each other a long time. And it is a pleasure to work with you and call you my friend.", "Sheldon: Little generic. Keep thinking. We\u2019ll circle back. Wil Wheaton, go.", "Wil: Sheldon, I know that we\u2019ve had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that my life is so much more interesting because you are in it. We may have met because you are a fan of Star Trek. But I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper. Live long and prosper, buddy. And happy birthday.", "General cheers.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s how you do it, Wolowitz. Now you see why he\u2019s famous and you\u2019re not.", "Beverley: Sheldon, I know the future holds great things for you, and we all can\u2019t wait to see what they are. Happy birthday, dear.", "General cheers.", "Barry: Someone caw Animal Contwol. There\u2019s a cougar on the woose.", "Beverley: Barry, stop.", "Leonard: Seriously, Barry, stop.", "Raj: And it was Gandhi who said, live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.", "Sheldon: And it was Sheldon Cooper who said let\u2019s speed this up. A lot of people want to talk.", "Leslie: Uh, in the past, I would\u2019ve said something obnoxious, like, happy birthday, dumbass. But I\u2019m not gonna do it. You and I have both grown a lot, and it\u2019s just so nice to see you all again. So, happy birthday, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Oh. Oh, now, you know I hate change. Say it.", "Leslie: Happy birthday, dumbass.", "General cheers.", "Adam: Happy birthday, young man. And if any of you have enjoyed seeing me here today, I\u2019m also available for Comic-Cons, bachelor parties, bar mitzvahs\u2026", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t think of anything to say that hasn\u2019t already been said, so, here\u2019s to you, Sheldon.", "General cheers.", "Sheldon: Thank you, Bernadette. That was perfect.", "Howard: What? You gotta be kidding me?", "Leonard: Sheldon, we\u2019ve been together so long, it\u2019s hard to remember a time you weren\u2019t in my life. And believe me, I try. You make me laugh. You make me a better scientist. You make me crazy. You\u2019re more than just my roommate, you\u2019re my brother.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Leonard: Happy birthday, buddy.", "General cheers.", "Sheldon: Thank you. That, that was wonderful.", "Penny: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Stuart didn\u2019t get to speak.", "Stuart: Oh, oh, okay. Um, uh, Sheldon, I\u2019ve spent most of my life feeling invisible, but having you and everyone\u2026", "Amy: Hey, everybody, listen up.", "Penny: You nailed it.", "Amy: We\u2019ve got someone who couldn\u2019t be here but really wanted to wish you a happy birthday.", "Stephen Hawking (on Skype): Hello, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Professor Hawking.", "Stephen: Happy birthday to you.", "Sheldon: Thank you so much. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re\u2026", "Stephen: Happy birthday to you.", "Sheldon: Oh, you\u2019re singing. Well, I\u2019m sorry.", "Stephen: Happy birthday, dear Sheldon.", "Leonard: Uh, Professor Hawking, if you just give us one second, we\u2019ll light the candles, and we can all sing together.", "Stephen: I was crushing it, but all right.", "Penny: Okay, while they get the cake, Sheldon, I just want to say, I hope you didn\u2019t think you were gonna get through tonight without a hug.", "Sheldon: You know, I used to hate these hugs. Now they\u2019re just extremely irritating.", "Leonard: Ready when you are, Professor Hawking.", "Stephen: And a one, and a two\u2026", "All: Happy birthday to you,", "Happy birthday to you,", "Happy birthday, dear Sheldon,", "Happy birthday to you.", "General cheers.", "Adam: So, who\u2019s taking me home?"]}
