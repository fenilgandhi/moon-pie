{"series": "9", "episode": "20", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment (initially inside a virtual reality device)", "Sheldon: It\u2019s nice to get back to nature. Why don\u2019t I do this more often? What a beautiful forest. Hello, little butterfly. What\u2019s your Na-oh!", "Leonard: Whatcha doing?", "Sheldon: I was enjoying some virtual reality, until you ruined it with your actual face.", "Penny: What am I smelling?", "Sheldon: Oh, it\u2019s car air freshener. I was simulating the smell of the forest.", "Penny: That\u2019s not what the forest smells like.", "Sheldon: Well, how would I know?", "Leonard: Why are you pretending to be outdoors? You hate it.", "Sheldon: Hmm? Oh. Amy showed me a compelling study that demonstrated the cognitive benefit of spending time in the wilderness.", "Leonard: Buddy, I am ready to drive you into the wilderness any time you want and leave you there.", "Sheldon: Well, make your jokes, but some of the participants who spent four days in the woods away from all technology reported a fifty percent gain in reasoning skills upon their return.", "Penny: Okay, if that\u2019s true, why aren\u2019t there more genius squirrels?", "Sheldon: You may need this more than I do.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Here\u2019s your tea.", "Sheldon: Oh. Do not sneak up on a guy when he\u2019s sitting on a log.", "Amy: You know, if you really want to be in nature, why don\u2019t we rent a cabin?", "Sheldon: Look, I\u2019m sorry, when did you even get here? I\u2026", "Penny: You know, there\u2019s a cabin in Big Bear that a doctor I work with keeps offering me.", "Leonard: Because he\u2019s hitting on you?", "Penny: She.", "Leonard: Oh, good.", "Penny: But I could get her.", "Amy: We could all go for the weekend. It\u2019ll be fun.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. Here, look up fun, get back to me.", "Leonard: You and I could still go and have a nice weekend.", "Penny: Sure.", "Amy: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go with them.", "Sheldon: I hardly think so. You be sure and say hello to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears, snakes, possums, poison oak, oh, and last, but not least, teenagers with guitars.", "Penny: I\u2019ll see if it\u2019s available.", "Amy: You know, if that study\u2019s real, Leonard might come back smarter than you.", "Sheldon: Are you trying to manipulate me?", "Amy: Yes.", "Sheldon: Well done, it worked, we\u2019re going.", "Amy: Yay.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Bernadette: Come on, Raj, give me a bag.", "Raj: No, no, you\u2019re pregnant. The only thing you carry is our hope for a better tomorrow.", "Howard: Hey, where you been?", "Bernadette: Uh, Raj took me to the baby doctor and then we swung by the grocery store.", "Howard: Did you get graham crackers? I mean, are, wuh, is the baby okay?", "Bernadette: Yes and yes.", "Howard: I didn\u2019t know you needed help running errands today.", "Bernadette: I didn\u2019t, but Raj volunteered.", "Howard: Really?", "Bernadette: Yeah, ever since you told him I was pregnant, he\u2019s really been making a fuss over me.", "Howard: Oh. Well, I guess that\u2019s kind of sweet.", "Raj: Bernie, I just forwarded you a list of the top five lactation consultants in Los Angeles. I know my favourite, but I\u2019d love to hear what you think.", "Howard: And it just got weird.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Hey. Amy\u2019s downstairs.", "Leonard: Okay, one sec.", "Penny: Uh, what, what you got goin\u2019 on here?", "Leonard: I bought a baseball cap.", "Penny: I can see that. What team did you get?", "Leonard: Uh, Hufflepuff, from Harry Potter.", "Penny: Well, we\u2019ll be in the woods.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m ready to go.", "Leonard: Anything you\u2019d like to say to him?", "Penny: Nice hat, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Thanks.", "Leonard: Why are you so mean to me?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. Screams are emanating from Bernadette\u2019s tablet.", "Howard: What the hell are you watching?", "Bernadette: Raj found all these childbirth videos online. This one is of a woman giving birth in a river.", "Howard: Okay, that is the least Jewish thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. You feel like Raj is getting a little carried away with all the baby stuff?", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t think so. He just wants to be part of the experience.", "Howard: All right, if you say so. What\u2019s in the box?", "Bernadette: Oh, it\u2019s an ultrasonic microphone so we can hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat.", "Howard: Oh. That\u2019s cool. Can we try it?", "Bernadette: Actually, Raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here.", "Howard: So he can be part of the experience?", "Bernadette: Yeah.", "Howard: I\u2019m surprised he let us conceive without him.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s a sore spot, don\u2019t bring it up.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Penny: It\u2019s so cute and rustic up here.", "Leonard: I know. Did you see they still have a video rental place? it\u2019s like Colonial Williamsburg.", "Sheldon: Well, cell service is down to one bar, so if anyone needs medical attention or to tell a stranger their political views are stupid, now\u2019s the time.", "Amy: Have you ever been off the grid before?", "Sheldon: Once. The battery ran out on my phone. I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.", "Leonard: I was afraid he was gonna eat me.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: Raj just pulled up. I\u2019m gonna say something to him.", "Bernadette: Leave it alone. He means well.", "Howard: So you don\u2019t think he needs to rein it in a little?", "Bernadette: No, not really.", "Howard: And you\u2019re not concerned he\u2019s acting like somehow this is his kid, too?", "Bernadette: He\u2019s just trying to be supportive.", "Howard: Just supportive. Not over-the-top in any way?", "Bernadette: No.", "Raj: Hello.", "Bernadette: You saw him carrying that.", "Howard: Astronauts saw him carrying that.", "Scene: The cabin. ", "Penny: This place is great.", "Leonard: So nice of that doctor to just let you use it.", "Penny: Well, she is taking me to an Indigo Girls concert, so hold that thought.", "Sheldon: Okay. Well, shall we check each other for ticks?", "Amy: Sheldon, all we did was walk in from the car.", "Sheldon: Oh. Well, suit yourself. Who wants to check me?", "Amy: On the other hand, safety first.", "Scene: The same, later.", "Amy: Wow, it\u2019s really coming down.", "Penny: This sucks.", "Leonard: And there goes our hike.", "Sheldon: Oh, not our hike, now we have to stay safe and warm.", "Penny: You know, we could still go. A little rain isn\u2019t gonna kill us.", "Leonard: Have you been outside in the rain with Sheldon?", "Penny: No.", "Leonard: You\u2019ll wish it would kill you.", "Amy: So what do we do now?", "Leonard: They have some board games.", "Sheldon: Eh, most of the Jenga pieces are missing and the Scrabble only has seven tiles, so unless you want to build an unimpressive structure with the word shnerpf next to it, move on.", "Penny: Hey, let\u2019s light a fire.", "Amy: Ooh, that sounds cozy.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve lit a real fire before.", "Sheldon: Ah, it\u2019s basic thermodynamics. I\u2019m sure we can figure that out.", "Leonard: I could stack the logs conically to facilitate airflow.", "Sheldon: That would maximize oxygen for optimal combustion.", "Leonard: Right. So all we need is to\u2026", "Penny: Got it.", "Leonard: A scientist made that.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Howard: Look, Raj, you\u2019re my best friend in the world and I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the baby.", "Raj: Please, my pleasure.", "Bernadette: And, of course, Howie and I both want you to be a part of all this.", "Howard: But we have to set some boundaries.", "Raj: I don\u2019t understand.", "Howard: The three of us aren\u2019t having this baby. Just the two of us.", "Howard: Oh. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I\u2019ll back off.", "Howard: Thanks for understanding.", "Raj: Of course. I\u2019ll give you guys some space. Let me just get this out of your way.", "Howard: You need some help?", "Raj: No, I got it.", "Bernadette: Raj, Raj, wait.", "Raj: Please, Bernadette. Let me leave with my dignity.", "Scene: The cabin.", "Penny: Hey, you guys want to play a drinking game?", "Sheldon: Oh, well now, we\u2019ll never win. You always play the drinking game.", "Penny: Not the drinking game, a drinking game.", "Leonard: To be fair, good at both.", "Amy: What\u2019s the game?", "Penny: All right, it\u2019s called Never Have I Ever. The rules are simple. Someone says something they\u2019ve never done, but if you have done it, you take a drink.", "Leonard: I\u2019ve never played that before.", "Sheldon: Hey, now, wait. Have we started? Do I drink? What is happening?", "Penny: Okay. Calm down. I\u2019ll go first. All right, let\u2019s see. Never have I ever\u2026", "Amy: She\u2019s trying to think of something she\u2019s never done before. This could take a while.", "Penny: Very funny. Okay, never have I ever\u2026 yeah, you know what? Let\u2019s just circle back.", "Leonard: Okay, I\u2019ll go. Never have I ever been arrested.", "Sheldon: So I drink.", "Amy: No, it\u2019s only if you\u2019ve done it.", "Sheldon: Got it.", "Amy: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve been arrested.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t believe Penny hasn\u2019t.", "Penny: Sheldon, what did you do?", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019m not proud of it, but I jaywalked.", "Leonard: Oh, no, it\u2019s like a horror movie. We\u2019re trapped in a cabin with a maniac.", "Amy: I\u2019m surprised you would do that.", "Sheldon: No, I crossed in the middle of the street. And normally, I wouldn\u2019t, but I saw an aggressive-looking Girl Scout, and it was the heart of cookie season. Anyway, there was a police officer, and he witnessed the whole thing.", "Penny: What, he arrested you for that?", "Sheldon: No, he didn\u2019t do anything. So I said, you just saw me jaywalk, why aren\u2019t you doing your job? You know? May, maybe I should arrest you for, for impersonating a police officer.", "Penny: And then you got arrested.", "Sheldon: Oh, and how.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Howard: I feel like I just made a horrible mistake.", "Bernadette: Yeah.", "Howard: But on the other hand, I didn\u2019t kick him out of our lives. I just asked him to back off a little.", "Bernadette: Yeah.", "Howard: What? Are you gonna cry?", "Bernadette: Yeah.", "Howard: Is it baby hormones or actually sad?", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t tell anymore.", "Howard: I\u2019ll go get him.", "Bernadette: And bring back the bear.", "Scene: The cabin. ", "Leonard: This game\u2019s dangerous. I could get you in trouble.", "Penny: How?", "Leonard: Well, never have I ever used Sheldon\u2019s toothbrush to clean the sink.", "Penny: Fine, is that how you want to play this? All right, never have I ever come up with a nickname for my own genitals.", "Leonard: Never should\u2019ve told you about Alvin and the Chipmunks.", "Amy: Okay. My turn. Um, never have I ever completely rocked my girlfriend\u2019s world in bed.", "Sheldon: Amy.", "Amy: You know the rules. Drink.", "Penny: Yeah, go ahead.", "Leonard: That\u2019s right.", "Sheldon: All right, my turn. Mm. Oh, I know. Never have I ever kept a secret bank account, because I think my wife can\u2019t handle money. Did I win? I feel like I won.", "Penny: I can\u2019t believe this. You realize I make more money than you?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t, I know, but this isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s just a little savings I put aside.", "Penny: We\u2019re married. We\u2019re supposed to share everything.", "Leonard: What, you mean, like, your massive credit card debt?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m calling it. I won.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Raj: I appreciate the apology, but it\u2019s really not necessary. I overstepped my bounds.", "Howard: No, Raj, you\u2019ve been great. I just, I need to start doing my part around here.", "Bernadette: I hear that.", "Raj: Well, if that\u2019s the case, is there anything I can do to help?", "Howard: Well, not right now. But we could try out that microphone you got us, and listen to the baby\u2019s heartbeat.", "Raj: Really? It\u2019s okay if I listen with you?", "Bernadette: Of course.", "Raj: Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly on your stomach?", "Howard: Hey, look at that. It\u2019s weird again.", "Scene: The cabin.", "Leonard: Okay, you have every right to be mad. And what you said is true. You do make more money than me. So I had no right to do what I did. And I\u2019m so sorry. I hope you can forgive me.", "Penny: How long have you had this secret account?", "Leonard: A couple years, but I just put a few bucks aside every month for emergencies.", "Penny: Well, how much you got in there?", "Leonard: Six thousand four hundred and twenty seven dollars. Forty seven dollars once my nana\u2019s birthday check gets here.", "Penny: My God, Leonard, do you know what I could do with that kind of money?", "Leonard: No, I do, and that\u2019s why I hid it.", "Penny: What good is it if you don\u2019t use it?", "Leonard: Uh, you have shoes you love, but never wear. I have money I love, but never spend. We\u2019re kind of a cute couple that way. Again, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret.", "Penny: Well, I have a secret I\u2019ve been keeping from you, too.", "Leonard: Is it a secret bank account? Because that would be awesome.", "Penny: I hate my job.", "Leonard: Really? Why?", "Penny: Because I don\u2019t feel good flirting with doctors for sales. I mean, I know I make a lot of money. But I haven\u2019t been happy for a while.", "Leonard: Why didn\u2019t you tell me?", "Penny: Because I know how important it is to you that I\u2019m having some success.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not true.", "Penny: Okay, really? So you\u2019d be fine if I went back to acting and waiting tables again?", "Leonard: If that\u2019s what you want to do, yes.", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s not what I want to do.", "Leonard: Oh, yes.", "Penny: Doesn\u2019t matter what I want. Look, this job is gonna get me out of debt. So I\u2019m gonna do the grown-up thing and see it through.", "Leonard: Well, that is the grown-up thing.", "Penny: I guess.", "Leonard: I love you.", "Penny: I love you, too.", "Leonard: You know, never have I ever made love in the forest while it was raining.", "Penny: Well, guess I gotta drink.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Howard: All right, here we go.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m not hearing anything.", "Howard: Well, give me a second.", "Raj: Are you sure you can do this?", "Howard: Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?", "Raj: I buried it there, so we could go home.", "Bernadette: Wait, that\u2019s it.", "Raj: Wow.", "Bernadette: Isn\u2019t that the best?", "Raj: You guys made a person.", "Howard: We did.", "Raj: And I like to think I helped.", "Howard: You didn\u2019t.", "Scene: The cabin. ", "Sheldon: Oh, never have I ever drunk milk past its expiration date.", "Amy: Never have I ever cancelled a dentist appointment.", "Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever put my foot in the ocean.", "Amy: Never have I ever honked if I liked anything.", "Sheldon: Oh, uh, never have I ever thrown, caught or touched a Frisbee.", "Amy: Never have I ever put salt on my food without trying it first.", "Sheldon: Oh. Never have I ever pushed all the buttons in an elevator.", "Amy: Well, we all have a past."]}
