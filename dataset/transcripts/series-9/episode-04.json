It\u2019s like I died and went to the post-mortem, neuron-induced hallucination commonly mistaken as heaven.", "Leonard: I still don\u2019t understand why you bought that pill caddie. You\u2019re a young man.", "Sheldon: Age is a state of mind, Leonard. In here I\u2019m 90. Why are you taking your bins over there?", "Leonard: It\u2019s just where I need them. You know, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of closet space.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s wrong with your closet?", "Penny: Uh, well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together.", "Sheldon: So that\u2019s all this day was? A plan to butter me up before delivering bad news?", "Leonard: Come on, buddy.", "Sheldon: No, I thought we were friends. You asked for a sip of my Icee. If you had your own straw, I might\u2019ve said yes.", "Penny: Sheldon, please, we already feel bad about this.", "Sheldon: You know what they don\u2019t sell at The Container Store? Something large enough to contain my disappointment. Although, if anyone did, it would be them.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Sheldon: Thank you for letting me come speak with you.", "Bernadette: Of course.", "Sheldon: As my relationships with Penny and Amy are currently strained, I\u2019m turning to you for female comfort and encouragement.", "Bernadette: Aw. I\u2019m honoured.", "Sheldon: I tried reaching out to my mother, but she was in Bible study. Leonard\u2019s mother is on a book tour. My Mee-Maw was taking a nap, and after a while Siri started repeating her answers.", "Bernadette: So, I\u2019m your seventh choice.", "Sheldon: Yeah, I know, top ten, pretty exciting.", "Bernadette: How can I help you?", "Sheldon: Well, in addition to Amy leaving me, Leonard\u2019s moving in with Penny. It\u2019s difficult not to feel abandoned.", "Bernadette: Well, why don\u2019t you look at this as an opportunity? You had other roommates before Leonard. Maybe this is a chance to find someone new.", "Sheldon: Perhaps I could find someone better than Leonard. Someone I can rub in his face. Chris Pratt\u2019s all the rage right now. I wonder how he\u2019d feel about taking the smaller bedroom.", "Stuart: Hey.", "Bernadette: Hey. You know who would be the perfect roomie?", "Sheldon: Gandalf, but he\u2019s a smoker.", "Bernadette: Stuart. He\u2019s been living with us for a while now. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to get us out of his hair.", "Stuart: Nope, couldn\u2019t be happier.", "Bernadette: Well, Sheldon\u2019s looking for a roommate.", "Stuart: Nope.", "Bernadette: He\u2019ll think about it.", "Stuart: No I won\u2019t.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Raj: Have you seen this Archie comic? It\u2019s actually Archie versus Predator.", "Howard: How could Archie defeat Predator?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know. Maybe Jughead\u2019s a Terminator.", "Stuart: Hey.", "Howard: Hey, Stuart.", "Stuart: Do you guys know any musicians?", "Howard: Why?", "Stuart: I was thinking it might be cool to have live music here a few nights a week. You know, give this place more of a staying in business vibe.", "Howard: What kind of music are you thinking of?", "Stuart: I like all kinds of music, but my favourite genre is free.", "Raj: Hey, we\u2019ve always talked about playing together.", "Howard: Well, it could be fun to try a little acoustic thing.", "Raj: Oh, we could play filk music.", "Stuart: What\u2019s that?", "Raj: It\u2019s been around for years. It\u2019s like folk music, but with a sci-fi/fantasy theme.", "Stuart: I like it. It sounds exactly like something I shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for.", "Raj: Dude, if we do this, we\u2019re gonna need a cool band name.", "Howard: You know, I\u2019ve actually had one I\u2019ve been sitting on for years.", "Raj: Really?", "Howard: It was for this power trio I tried to put together in junior high, but I was short two friends.", "Raj: What is it?", "Howard: Footprints on the Moon.", "Raj: I just got chills.", "Howard: So did I.", "Stuart: Me, too. But I, uh, might have Lyme Disease.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Just a few more signatures, and we\u2019ll be finished. Initial here to acknowledge that you\u2019ve returned your key. Okay. As my future neighbour, I\u2019d like you to have a key. Initial here to acknowledge you received it.", "Penny: I\u2019m proud of you. You\u2019re taking this really well.", "Sheldon: Well, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m never going to see you two again. Which brings us to article 23 subsection C, please check here to reserve your spot at the ten year roommate reunion.", "Leonard: Do I really have to do that now?", "Sheldon: No, but if you want chicken and get stuck with the fish, that\u2019s on you. All right. Oh, and lastly, please initial here to confirm that ownership of the living room couch is hereby transferred to me in perpetuity all throughout the universe and all alternate universes except for those universes where owning a couch is forbidden by the hive queen. In which case, all glory to the hive queen. All right, now all that\u2019s left is for us to sign and date the document, and we will officially no longer be roommates.", "Penny: What\u2019s the matter?", "Leonard: It\u2019s harder than I thought.", "Sheldon: Let me help you. L. E. O. N.", "Leonard: That helped.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Raj: So I have an idea for a filk song. It\u2019s kind of a, a power ballad, superhero crossover tale of epic proportions.", "Howard: Is it cold in here, \u2019cause, oh, my.", "Raj: Okay, so it\u2019s a, it\u2019s a David and Goliath story. It\u2019s about man against God. It\u2019s called Hammer and Whip, The Untold Story of Thor versus Indiana Jones.", "Howard: Thor versus Indiana Jones? You just blew my filking mind.", "Raj: Okay, I don\u2019t have it all worked out yet, but I was thinking something like, um, Oh, Indy, oh, Indy, the skies are so windy. Is that a flying man with a killer bod? Wait, that\u2019s no man, it\u2019s a Norse god.", "Howard: Oh yes, definitely. Hang on. Thunder clapped as Thor raised his mighty hammer. Indy rapped, that\u2019s one bad mamma-jamma.", "Raj: That is, that is so good!", "Howard: Right? Mamma-jamma just came to me.", "Raj: Okay, and here\u2019s the hook. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.", "Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.", "Howard: Oh, man, that rocks.", "Raj: Hey, remember The Ark of the Covenant?", "Howard: Yeah?", "Raj: That\u2019s how much we\u2019re gonna melt people\u2019s faces off.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: I appreciate your interest in the apartment. I just need to ask you a few standard questions.", "Bespectacled Man: Sure.", "Sheldon: It says here you\u2019re a chemist. Which element on the periodic table do you feel is too big for its britches?", "Bespectacled Man: Is that supposed to be a joke?", "Sheldon: Looks like argon\u2019s not the only one with an attitude problem.", "Fade to another candidate.", "Sheldon: In general, would you say that you smell better, worse or the same as you do right now?", "Fade to another candidate.", "Sheldon: I was going to ask you what is the best fruit, but then I realized what I want to ask you is why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm, but then I realized what I really want to ask you is just can you just go?", "Fade to another candidate.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re healthy. You have a job in the sciences. I\u2019ve got to say, if this credit report comes back good, you\u2019re the frontrunner.", "Amy (on Skype): I\u2019m not gonna be your roommate, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: But I met with 11 people, and they all walked out. And that Hollywood phoney Chris Pratt never tweeted me back.", "Amy: I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find somebody else.", "Sheldon: I suppose. What happened to me, Amy? Years ago I was completely disengaged from my feelings. I\u2019d say it was a happier time, but I was disengaged from my feelings, so who can tell?", "Amy: I don\u2019t know how to help you. You know, feelings are a part of life.", "Sheldon: They didn\u2019t used to be. You and Leonard and Penny, you all poisoned me with emotions. I was like the Tin Man, perfectly content until that evil wizard gave him a heart.", "Amy: I don\u2019t think that was the point of the movie.", "Sheldon: Fine, then I was like Pinocchio before that jerk Geppetto went and made him a real boy.", "Amy: There you go.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: So, what are you thinking for dinner?", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s Thai food night.", "Penny: Well, honey, you don\u2019t live with Sheldon any more. You can have anything you want.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right. But what? Mexican? Italian? German? Indian? Greek? Cuban? Chinese? Pizza? Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?", "Penny: How about Thai food?", "Leonard: Oh, thank God.", "Penny: Hey, we\u2019re going to dinner. You want to come?", "Sheldon: Oh, I wish I could, but I realized I\u2019ve become too emotionally vulnerable, so, like an operating system, I\u2019m restoring my life to the last stable version, which was in 2003, the day before I met Leonard.", "Leonard: You heard him, no.", "Penny: Hang on. Wait, you actually think it\u2019s 2003?", "Sheldon: No, just because I\u2019m living my life like it was 12 years ago doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m delusional. And since it is 2003, I don\u2019t know who you are, so please exit the premises before I call the police on my stylish new flip phone.", "Scene: A Thai restaurant.", "Penny: Are you doing okay?", "Leonard: I guess. I\u2019m just, you know, worried about Sheldon.", "Penny: Well, come on, he\u2019s a grown man in his 30s pretending to be a grown man in his 20s. He\u2019s fine.", "Leonard: I hope so.", "Penny: What else can you do? Move back in with him?", "Leonard: No, of course not. I just feel bad.", "Penny: Well, so do I, but don\u2019t you want to live with your wife and set the thermostat to whatever you want and have your body tell you when it\u2019s time to go to the bathroom, you know, not a schedule slipped underneath your door every morning?", "Leonard: I did like that he had the weather on it.", "Penny: Trust me, this is the right thing.", "Leonard: I know. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019re abandoning him. Plus, we can FaceTime him whenever we want, you know, once iPhones are invented in his universe.", "Scene: A bar.", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t believe Sheldon asked you to be his roommate.", "Amy: I can\u2019t believe he ran my credit.", "Bernadette: Hey, if you\u2019re open to living with someone great, I\u2019ll give you a thousand dollars to take Stuart.", "Amy: You really should\u2019ve gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives before you got one.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m sorry. I just thought you might have a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.", "Amy: Hey, I know Sheldon\u2019s quirky, but he\u2019s also brilliant and insightful. I think calling him a weirdo is a little unfair.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Hello, 2003.", "Leonard: Hey, we brought you Thai. Where is everything?", "Sheldon: In my present, it\u2019s in the future. In your present, it\u2019s been crammed in the bedroom by an enterprising young man I met in The Home Depot parking lot.", "Leonard: I know what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re trying to get attention so we\u2019ll feel bad for you, but it\u2019s not happening.", "Sheldon: No, what I\u2019m doing is trying to figure out how to live my life now that everyone is leaving me.", "Leonard: Will you knock it off? We\u2019re across the hall.", "Sheldon: As the kids are saying today, talk to the hand.", "Penny: They\u2019re not saying that.", "Sheldon: They are in 2003.", "Penny: No, no, they\u2019re really not.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj (singing): Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One runs from Loki, the other runs from stones. So, what do you think?", "Emily: Wow.", "Raj: Runs from stones means that, that big boulder, but I couldn\u2019t rhyme anything with boulder.", "Emily: Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder.", "Raj: Right, yeah, right. But, what do you think?", "Emily: I think it\u2019s very cute.", "Raj: Cute? It\u2019s not cute. Cute is children dressed as vegetables.", "Emily: Okay, fine, it\u2019s not cute.", "Raj: Just be honest. You don\u2019t like it.", "Emily: I didn\u2019t say that. I, I just like music you can dance to.", "Raj: You can dance to this. Um, uh, uh, Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Raj: I\u2019m telling you, dude, the song has no groove, you can\u2019t dance to it.", "Howard: Who cares? I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.", "Raj: You can do both, like Michael Jackson\u2019s Billie Jean. While you\u2019re dancing you\u2019re thinking, like, darn it, whose baby is it?", "Howard: Where\u2019s this coming from? A few hours ago, we both loved this song.", "Raj: I still love it. I just think there\u2019s room for improvement.", "Howard: You played it for Emily, didn\u2019t you?", "Raj: Yeah, so what?", "Howard: You are such a wimp. She didn\u2019t like it, now you don\u2019t like it.", "Raj: No, no. I\u2019m just evolving as a musician. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s stuck in the past.", "Howard: The past was lunch. You know what\u2019s really happening here? Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.", "Raj: She has nothing to do with this. I am my own man.", "Howard: Oh, please. Your brain belongs to whoever\u2019s willing to sleep with you.", "Raj: That is so not true.", "Howard: Really? Remember when you were gonna get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?", "Raj: That had nothing to do with Rachel. It was an overreaction to a bad zipper injury.", "Howard: I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019m quitting the band.", "Raj: Fine, I quit, too.", "Howard: Then get out of my house.", "Raj: With pleasure.", "Howard: Raj, wait.", "Raj: What took you so long?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it\u2019s not.", "Sheldon: How can you say that? Amy\u2019s gone, and you two are married now, so it\u2019s only a matter of time before you\u2019re gone, too.", "Penny: Okay, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen.", "Sheldon: No, I do. Eventually you\u2019ll want more space, and you\u2019ll move into a house, and then instead of dinner a couple of times a week, it\u2019ll only be a couple of times a month, and then it\u2019ll only be on special occasions, like when Bernadette divorces Wolowitz. Or, or, or like when Koothrappali\u2019s weird girlfriend admits where she buried his body. Or Amy\u2019s wedding, where she\u2019s marrying someone better than me.", "Penny: Okay, look, we don\u2019t need to rush into anything. All right? Maybe instead of Leonard moving in with me, we just leave things the way they are, and sometimes we\u2019ll sleep over there, and sometimes we\u2019ll sleep over here.", "Sheldon: But mostly here.", "Penny: Sure.", "Leonard: Wuh, what about what you said in the restaurant?", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s not forever. It\u2019s just for a while. If you want, we can think of him like he\u2019s our dog.", "Sheldon: You can. I\u2019m happy when you come home. And I\u2019m scared of fireworks. By the way, on July Fourth, we\u2019re all sleeping here.", "Leonard: Fine.", "Sheldon: All right, great. Just give me one minute, and I\u2019ll get started on a new roommate agreement. Yeah. nothing from Pratt, we\u2019re good.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Howard (singing): Indy\u2019 whip snapped, Thor\u2019s hammer missed.", "Raj (singing): It was Avenger versus archeologist.", "Howard: Indy held his ground, and straightened his fedora.", "Raj: Thor said, that\u2019s a nice look in nineteen fourty-foura.", "Together: Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones. Thor and Dr. Jones. Thor and Dr. Jones. One plays with lightning, the other plays with bones.", "Stuart: Play something we can dance to."]}
