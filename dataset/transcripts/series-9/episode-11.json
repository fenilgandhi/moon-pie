You\u2019re sure they\u2019re Star Wars tickets?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.", "Sheldon: The Web site\u2019s frozen. I can\u2019t get in.", "Leonard: Yeah, me, too.", "Howard: Same here!", "Raj: Guys, they\u2019re gonna sell out.", "Howard: What are we gonna do?!", "Sheldon: All right, this goes against everything I stand for, but desperate times call for desperate measures. Lord, this is Sheldon Cooper. You\u2019re good friends with my mom. I know I\u2019ve spent my life denying that you exist.", "Howard: Got \u2019em.", "Sheldon: And I will continue to do so!", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: I\u2019m really happy you and Amy are back together.", "Sheldon: Oh, thank you.", "Leonard: I\u2019m also really happy, but I can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s for you. New Star Wars in three days.", "Sheldon: Hey, Thursday can\u2019t get here soon enough. I\u2019m taking off work to watch the original trilogy while I eat enough Star Wars cereal to choke a Wookiee.", "Penny: Uh, sweetie, you do realize Thursday is Amy\u2019s birthday.", "Sheldon: And you do realize I bought my ticket when Amy and I were broken up? I hope you didn\u2019t need anything in that case, \u2019cause it\u2019s closed.", "Penny: You guys just got back together. You might not want to ditch her on her birthday.", "Leonard: I think Penny has a point. You can see it another day.", "Sheldon: But someone might spoil the movie. No one can spoil Amy\u2019s birthday for me. Surprise, she\u2019s even older. Who saw that coming?", "Penny: Aw, that\u2019s nice. Put that on her cake.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Arthur: Oh, great. This again.", "Sheldon: Arthur, what brings you back?", "Arthur: Uh, beats me. I, I just hope this isn\u2019t a, a sex dream.", "Sheldon: In the past, you\u2019ve come to me when I\u2019m struggling with a dilemma.", "Arthur: And, and the one time where, where you were afraid, and you needed me for, for a night light. What\u2019s, what\u2019s troubling you?", "Sheldon: Well, my friends are telling me I shouldn\u2019t abandon my girlfriend on her birthday to see the new Star Wars movie.", "Arthur: Well, sounds right. Can, can I get out of this muumuu now?", "Sheldon: Those are the robes of the Jedi, the guardians of peace and justice in the galaxy.", "Arthur: And they, they, they don\u2019t wear underwear.", "Sheldon: So, you agree with my friends that I should skip the premiere?", "Arthur: Uh, do, do you love this girl?", "Sheldon: Yes. But she knows how important Star Wars is to me.", "Arthur: Well, maybe you should show her how, how important she is to you.", "Sheldon: By seeing the movie she\u2019d want me to see?", "Arthur: Sheldon, you, you can see this movie whenever you want. But you only have a limited number of days that you, you can be with this woman. Be with her.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right.", "Arthur: Great.", "Sheldon: Where are you going?", "Arthur: I don\u2019t know, but hopefully, somewhere I can wear pants.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s bedroom. ", "Amy (answering phone): Sheldon, what\u2019s wrong?", "Sheldon: I wanted to let you know I\u2019ll be spending your birthday with you.", "Amy: Okay.", "Sheldon: See, I, I had tickets to the Star Wars premiere that night, but Professor Proton came to me in a dream dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi and convinced me I should be with you.", "Amy: Obi-what?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll let you get back to sleep now. Good night.", "Amy: Okay. Good night. Wait. Um, Sheldon, were you actually not gonna spend my birthday with me?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s late. Got to go. Bye.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Good for Sheldon deciding to stay with Amy on her birthday.", "Leonard: I know. It\u2019s still gonna be weird to see the movie without him.", "Howard: Well, we could wait a couple days and see it together. (all laugh) ", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Leonard: Hey. We\u2019re going to the comic book store. You want to come?", "Sheldon: No, I can\u2019t. I need to make preparations for Amy\u2019s birthday. Which leads me to the following bit of business. This is my ticket to Star Wars. I don\u2019t have to tell you it is worth far more than its face value of fifteen dollars and fifty cents. I trust you\u2019ll give it to someone worthy.", "Leonard: You got it. Well, Penny might want to join us.", "Sheldon (to Howard): This is my ticket to Star Wars\u2026.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Bernadette: What happens if I say, come in?", "Penny: Well, find out.", "Bernadette: Come in.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette. (Knock, knock, knock) Bernadette.", "Penny: Come in.", "Sheldon: Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.", "Bernadette: Just come in.", "Sheldon: For future reference, if I want to watch Mean Girls, I\u2019ll stream it on Netflix.", "Penny: We\u2019re sorry. What do you need?", "Sheldon: Well, as you know, I\u2019ll be celebrating Amy\u2019s birthday with her, and I could use your assistance in helping me select the perfect gift.", "Bernadette: Sure.", "Sheldon: Well, so far, I\u2019ve come up with three ideas. The first is a chance for her to play the harp with the L.A. Philharmonic.", "Penny: Wow. You can really arrange that?", "Sheldon: Well, I said a chance, you know. When you tell them it\u2019s your birthday at Bennigan\u2019s, they make a fuss. I don\u2019t see why the Philharmonic would be any different.", "Bernadette: How about something a little more realistic?", "Sheldon: Well, Amy enjoys knitting her own sweaters, so I was thinking of getting her an all-expense-paid trip to the Wisconsin Sheep and Wool Festival.", "Penny: Sorry. I was waiting for the bazinga.", "Bernadette: Hold on. It could be romantic. The two of them away together, keeping each other warm in snowy Wisconsin.", "Sheldon: No, no, no, no. She\u2019d be going alone. Well, if you think I\u2019m afraid of birds, you should see me around sheep.", "Penny: Okay, well, what\u2019s the third option?", "Sheldon: That I have coitus with her.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Leonard: What do you think about giving Sheldon\u2019s ticket to Stuart?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know. Have you ever seen a movie with Stuart before?", "Howard: It\u2019s like going with your grandpa. Instead of eating popcorn, he brings little pieces of chicken in Tupperware and a thermos full of soup.", "Leonard: He\u2019s not that bad. Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?", "Stuart: My, uh, my doctor\u2019s worried about my circulation, so I was thinking about walking around the mall. Why?", "Leonard: Well\u2026", "Wil Wheaton: Hey, you guys.", "Howard: Oh, make sure to wear sensible shoes. Wil, want to go to Star Wars Thursday?", "Wil: Absolutely.", "Stuart: Fine, take Wil. See if he brings you clam chowder.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Let\u2019s, let\u2019s, let\u2019s just recap our options. All right, we\u2019ve got harp thing, sheep thing.", "Bernadette: Wild thang.", "Sheldon: Which do you think she\u2019d prefer? Because I checked the Sheep and Wool Festival Web site, and there\u2019s only 8,000 tickets left.", "Penny: Sheldon, being physical with Amy is a huge step for you.", "Bernadette: Yeah, are you ready for this?", "Sheldon: Intimacy in any form has been challenging for me, but I\u2019d like to show her how important she is, and it feels like now might be the right time.", "Penny: Sheldon, that\u2019s so beautiful.", "Sheldon: Then it\u2019s settled. Amy\u2019s birthday present will be my genitals.", "Scene: The stairwell. ", "Amy: Thanks for taking me out.", "Penny: Well, you\u2019re spending your birthday with Sheldon. Why not celebrate early?", "Bernadette: So where do you want to go?", "Amy: I heard that new Mexican place on Green Street is good.", "Penny: Sure, sure. Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.", "Amy: Why would I get a bikini wax for my birthday?", "Penny: Uh, I don\u2019t know. It was just a thought.", "Amy: I think I\u2019ll just stick to Mexican.", "Bernadette: Great. And then maybe after, we can watch a dirty movie, and if anybody has any questions about what happened or how, we can answer them.", "Amy: Okay, what is going on?", "Penny: Oh, we just want you to be prepared for any surprises that might happen tomorrow.", "Amy: What surprises?", "Bernadette: We don\u2019t want to spoil anything, but you should know that Sheldon said he\u2019s ready to be physical.", "Amy: You shut your damn mouth. You actually heard him say this?", "Penny: Yes. He said he wants to do something to show you how much you mean to him.", "Amy: I, I can\u2019t believe it. I, I don\u2019t know what to say.", "Bernadette: Well, we\u2019re really happy for you, and we know how much he cares\u2026", "Amy: I do know what to say. Let\u2019s get me waxed.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Arthur: Why isn\u2019t it ever Angie Dickinson\u2019s bedroom?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re back.", "Arthur: It, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s up to me.", "Sheldon: I suppose you\u2019re here because I\u2019ve decided to be physical with my girlfriend, and I\u2019ve never done that before.", "Arthur: Eh, excuse me for a moment. Well, it was worth a shot.", "Sheldon: So, can you help me?", "Arthur: Uh, all right. Um, once, once the man gets the, the woman out of her, out of her bloomers\u2026", "Sheldon: Oh, no. Not that. I, I understand the mechanics.", "Arthur: Oh, good, good. \u2018Cause, uh, I have no idea what kids these days are calling their, their parts.", "Sheldon: I think they say junk.", "Arthur: What is happening to this world? What, what do you actually need to know?", "Sheldon: This is an important night for us, and I\u2019m worried I might be overwhelmed and ruin everything.", "Arthur: Sheldon, if, if you\u2019re with the right person, it, it\u2019ll be okay.", "Sheldon: Thank you, Arthur. You are the wisest of the wise.", "Arthur: Well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s very nice of you to say, but I think I\u2019m just an expression of, of your unconscious mind.", "Sheldon: Oh, sure. Well, you\u2019re fun to look at.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Tonight\u2019s the night.", "Leonard: Yeah, the wait is finally over.", "Penny: I know. Then you\u2019ll finally stop talking about it.", "Howard: Ready to go?", "Raj: Let\u2019s do this.", "Penny: Have fun, guys.", "Leonard: We will.", "Raj: I can\u2019t believe Sheldon gave this up.", "Howard: I know.", "Leonard: We\u2019re gonna have so much more fun than him.", "Bernadette: No, they\u2019re not.", "Penny: Knowing them, they will.", "Scene: The cinema.", "Howard: T minus 15 minutes.", "Raj: Oh, did you hear from Wil?", "Leonard: Yeah, he\u2019s on his way. Time for bladder check.", "Raj: Check.", "Leonard: Check.", "Howard: Check. Wait. Screw it. I\u2019m holding it.", "Raj: What is everyone booing at?", "Wil: Hey, guys. What\u2019s up?", "Leonard: Um, hey, Wil. What you doin\u2019?", "Wil: I was on Star Trek. Just rooting for the home team.", "Man: Star Trek stinks!", "Wil: Yeah? Live long and suck it.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl. (Knock, knock, knock) Birthday girl.", "Amy: Come in.", "Sheldon: Oh.", "Amy: Hi, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Hello. Sorry I\u2019m late. I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.", "Amy: That\u2019s okay. Come on in. Thank you. Um, I\u2019ll, I\u2019m gonna go put these in water.", "Sheldon: Okay. Ooh, this is different, hmm? Candles and music.", "Amy: Do you like it?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s kind of spooky.", "Amy: I can change it back.", "Sheldon: No, no, no. It\u2019s your birthday. As long as no one jumps out in a hockey mask, I\u2019ll be fine.", "Amy: So, what\u2019d you have in mind for tonight?", "Sheldon: I thought I could take you out to a nice birthday dinner. If we pick a place east of here, we might find the balloon.", "Amy: Um, that sounds nice, but I\u2019m not really hungry right now. I thought maybe we could do presents first.", "Sheldon: Oh. All right. Um. I should probably tell you something about this gift.", "Amy: You mean before you give it to me?", "Sheldon: Yes. May I ask you a question before I give it to you?", "Amy: Of course.", "Sheldon: Why are we saying give it to you like that?", "Amy: Sheldon, I know your present is for us to be intimate tonight.", "Sheldon: I see. Is that all right? I\u2019m sorry, but this is a litigious society. I\u2019m gonna need verbal consent.", "Amy: Yes.", "Sheldon: You know what, let me pull a quick contract off the Internet.", "Scene: The cinema. ", "Leonard: So, if you don\u2019t like Star Wars, why are you here?", "Wil: Oh, I\u2019m just having fun. Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously. Like if the movie\u2019s bad, it\u2019s gonna ruin their lives.", "Raj: Is it bad? Did you hear something? Oh, my God. It\u2019s bad. Somebody kill me.", "Wil: See? That\u2019s what I mean. When you wake up in the morning, whether this is the greatest movie ever or a total piece of crap, your life isn\u2019t gonna change at all.", "Howard: He\u2019s right.", "Leonard: Yeah. No matter what happens, we\u2019re coming back tomorrow to watch it again.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Bernadette: Do you think Sheldon\u2019s actually gonna go through with it?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. He said he\u2019s ready.", "Bernadette: Yeah, but he also swore this was the year he\u2019d be able to pull the guts out of a pumpkin.", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m gonna stay positive. I mean, we talked, I told him what women like, and after he stopped giggling, he seemed pretty sure of himself.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s bedroom.", "Amy: Hi.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Amy: So, um, should I get under the covers with you?", "Sheldon: All right. Hello.", "Amy: Hi.", "Sheldon: Why are you shaking? Are you cold?", "Amy: I\u2019m just, um, really nervous.", "Sheldon: Why?", "Amy: Well, I\u2019ve been waiting for this for so long, I\u2019ve just built it up in my head. I don\u2019t know what to expect.", "Sheldon: Neither do I. But we can find out together.", "Amy: Okay.", "Scene: The cinema. ", "Leonard: I\u2019m really nervous.", "Howard: I know. We\u2019ve been waiting so long for this.", "Raj: And we\u2019ve built it up in our heads so much.", "Wil: Guys, it\u2019s just a movie.", "Leonard: That\u2019s true.", "Howard: He\u2019s right.", "Raj: It is.", "Wil: Although, we all remember Jar Jar.", "Raj: Leonard, I, I\u2019m scared again.", "Caption: A few hours later, in a bedroom not far away\u2026.", "Sheldon: Well, I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.", "Amy: Me, too.", "Sheldon: I look forward to your next birthday when we do it again.", "Amy: That works for me.", "Scene: The cinema.", "Wil: I enjoyed that more than I thought I would.", "Raj: I don\u2019t think I can walk right now.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Arthur: Uh, Sheldon? Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Arthur. What are you doing here? I, I don\u2019t think I need any more advice.", "Arthur: I, I was just curious. How, how\u2019d it go?", "Sheldon: Oh. It was amazing. I, I saw it a few days later. What a movie.", "Arthur: But, uh, what, what about Amy?", "Sheldon: Oh. Uh, uh, she liked it fine. But she doesn\u2019t have the history with the franchise I do.", "Arthur: Okay. Good, good talk."]}
