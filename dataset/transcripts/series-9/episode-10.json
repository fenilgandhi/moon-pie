My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry. It\u2019s only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades. I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.", "Scene: The apartment. 2 days earlier.", "Leonard: Since when do you hum songs?", "Sheldon: What are you talking about?", "Leonard: You were just humming.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.", "Leonard: How does your brain feel about calculating the surface tension of the domain walls?", "Sheldon: Let\u2019s see. Hey, I was humming. One point for Hufflepuff. What song is that?", "Leonard: Well, hum it again. Is that the SpongeBob song?", "Sheldon (singing): Who lives in a pineapple. Nope.", "Leonard: Whatever. Can we just get back to this?", "Sheldon: I feel like I know what song that is, but I can\u2019t put my finger on it. (Singing) My country, \u2019tis of thee. No.", "Leonard: It\u2019s just an earworm. It\u2019ll come to you.", "Sheldon: Okay. (Singing) R-E-S-P-E-C-T. No.", "Leonard: Is this what we\u2019re doing the rest of the night?", "Sheldon (singing): I\u2019m surprised you have to ask.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon (on phone): Hello, yes, I was hoping you could help me. What song is this? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. You don\u2019t know? Well, how dare you call yourselves a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame? My goodness. Do you sing along to the greatest hits of Elvis Presley with that mouth? Well, they were no help at all.", "Leonard: Which is crazy, since rock and roll is all about good customer service.", "Penny: Yeah. So you have a song stuck in your head. It happens to everybody.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019m not everybody. I have an eidetic memory. I should be able to remember what song this is, but I can\u2019t. Something\u2019s wrong with me.", "Penny: I told you if we were patient, he\u2019d figure it out for himself.", "Sheldon: I was always afraid this day would come. This might be the first step of my descent into madness, where I gradually test the limits of public nudity.", "Penny: Public nudity?", "Leonard: Eh, that just means going barefoot.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Dave (voice on phone): Hello?", "Amy: Hi, Dave. Uh, it\u2019s Amy.", "Dave: Oh. How are you?", "Amy: I\u2019m fine. How are you?", "Dave: Terrific. And pleasantly surprised to hear from you, given how I acted on our last date.", "Amy: Yeah, well, we both made mistakes, you know. I took the last breadstick, you gushed over my ex-boyfriend like he was Leonard Nimoy and you were my ex-boyfriend.", "Dave: So, to what do I owe the pleasure?", "Amy: Well, I was wondering if you\u2019d like to get dinner again sometime.", "Dave: Yes, please.", "Amy: Great.", "Dave: Let me just check my schedule, he said, trying to seem like a man with things on his schedule.", "Amy: How \u2019bout Saturday?", "Dave: Uh, hmm, let me see. Uh, Friday, farmers\u2019 market with Jay Z. Sunday, piano shopping with Elton John. Saturday works.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s workshop.", "Raj: Oh. Did you know, at the United Nations, there\u2019s a Department for Outer Space Affairs?", "Howard: Really? Why?", "Raj: They exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization.", "Howard: Mm, boy, that\u2019s one of those jobs that\u2019s boring, boring, boring, then, oh, God, where\u2019s the memo with what we do now?", "Raj: Oh, this is cool. So, a few weeks ago I set up a fan page on Facebook for our band and\u2026", "Howard: Wait a second. How could you do that without consulting me?", "Raj: It\u2019s not a big deal. It just took, like, five minutes to set up.", "Howard: That\u2019s not the point. When we created Footprints on the Moon, we agreed that every band decision would be mutual. Now you\u2019re just trying to take over the whole thing. You know, maybe I should go solo.", "Raj: But someone joined our page. We have an actual fan.", "Howard: All right. This thing\u2019s bigger than you and me, band\u2019s back together.", "Raj: So, listen to what he wrote. Uh, I saw you play at the comic book store. You guys rock. And then there\u2019s an animated smiley face raising the roof like this.", "Howard: We did raise the roof that night.", "Raj: Yeah, we totally did.", "Howard: Why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon (singing): Why can\u2019t I recall this song? This is taking far too long. The urge to bang my head against the wall again and again and again and again and again is strong.", "Leonard: Put on some headphones.", "Sheldon (singing): No they make my earlobes sweat.", "Penny: Hey, sweetie, why don\u2019t you take a break and do something else for a while?", "Sheldon: There was a project I\u2019ve been thinking about starting.", "Penny: Okay, great. What is it?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll show you. (Into phone camera) Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, you were driven mad by an earworm. Your mind, once your most trusted asset, is now a sack of parrots and monkeys. So, I\u2019m going to tell you everything you need to know. Uh, first, music is dangerous. The movie Footloose tried to warn us, but we wouldn\u2019t listen. Oh, wait. (Singing) Everyody cut footloose. Nope.", "Penny: I\u2019ll pay a thousand dollars to watch you cut footloose.", "Sheldon: This is Penny. She is your friend. If she offers you food, it\u2019s safe to take it. You probably paid for it, anyway.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: So, you\u2019re really going out with Dave again?", "Amy: Why not? He\u2019s actually a very nice guy.", "Bernadette: But he spent an entire date talking about how much he loves Sheldon.", "Amy: That\u2019s nothing Sheldon hasn\u2019t done before. Dave\u2019s just a big fan of his work. Besides, he said he wouldn\u2019t bring it up again.", "Bernadette: Okay. So where\u2019s he taking you?", "Amy: Oh, he\u2019s coming here. I\u2019m actually making dinner.", "Bernadette: Oh. That\u2019s a big step.", "Amy: It is?", "Bernadette: Yeah. You\u2019re inviting him into your home. It\u2019s intimate. It\u2019s where your underpants live.", "Amy: You know what? Good. I tried to get back together with Sheldon, he shot me down. Dave likes me. Maybe intimate is what I need.", "Bernadette: You sure? You\u2019ve never really been with a man. Do you really want to start with one that\u2019s six-foot-seven?", "Amy: Why not?", "Bernadette: \u2018Cause it\u2019s like taking your driver\u2019s test in a bus.", "Scene: Howard\u2019s workshop.", "Raj: Maybe we should post a comment back to our fan and thank him.", "Howard: What should we write?", "Raj: How about, uh, oh, how about, we might be Footprints on the Moon, but your kind words sent us over the moon.", "Howard: Someday you\u2019re gonna make an amazing grandma.", "Raj: Well what do you want to write?", "Howard: Something badass, you know, like, thanks for diggin\u2019 our vibe. We\u2019ll keep rockin\u2019 if you keep rollin\u2019.", "Raj: Dude, if I was wearing a bra, I\u2019d throw it at your head right now.", "Howard: I\u2019ll keep rockin\u2019. You don\u2019t do that.", "Raj: Okay. I posted it.", "Howard: So, who is this guy?", "Raj: Let\u2019s see. Uh, his name is Trent Monaco.", "Howard: Cool name.", "Raj: Yeah. He\u2019s 24. He\u2019s a deejay. He brews his own beer. He\u2019s got awesome tattoos. Dude, he\u2019s got a hot girlfriend, too.", "Howard: Damn. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s our biggest fan or I\u2019m his. Hey, Trent just liked our comment.", "Raj: He is so cool. Hey, no hard feelings, but I\u2019m throwing my hypothetical bra at him.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is playing his tune on a keyboard in the background.", "Penny: Oh, my God, he won\u2019t stop.", "Leonard: How does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying?", "Penny: Nobody knows. That\u2019s why he\u2019s number one. Can you please go talk to him?", "Leonard: Come on. I take care of him all day long. You do it for once.", "Penny: Once? Who got the gum out of his hair?", "Leonard: What do you want, a medal? It was your gum.", "Penny: Fine.", "Leonard: I love you.", "Penny: Who cares?", "Sheldon (off): What are you doing in my room? Stop it. That\u2019s mine. Why are you so strong?", "Penny: Problem solved.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Dear Crazy Future Sheldon, this is a thermostat. It controls the temperature of the apartment. The ideal setting is 72 degrees. If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket. A straitjacket, \u2019cause 72\u2019s the best and you\u2019re crazy. Now, this is your spot. You\u2019re very protective of it. When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly. It sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable. People are also delighted by your love of pranks. For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee. It wasn\u2019t replace it with Folger\u2019s crystals, I\u2019ll tell you that much.", "Leonard: Hey, can we please get back to work?", "Sheldon: This is Leonard. He\u2019s your best friend in the world.", "Leonard: All right, just stop. This is ridiculous.", "Sheldon: Sometimes he gets cranky, but you can trust him with your life. And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, he\u2019s drinking it.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Howard: Look at this. Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.", "Raj: That is so cool. Old broken things are so much better than new things that work.", "Bernadette: Who\u2019s Trent?", "Howard: Oh, he\u2019s our fan.", "Bernadette: Fan of what?", "Howard: Uh, did you forget? We\u2019re in a band.", "Bernadette: You mean because you played one time in the comic book store?", "Howard: And at the children\u2019s hospital until they asked us to leave.", "Raj: Hey, dude, Trent just checked in at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.", "Howard: Really? You want to go down there and meet him?", "Bernadette: Are you stalking him? That\u2019s creepy.", "Raj: It\u2019s not creepy. I built a Footprints on the Moon fan page, Trent joined it.", "Howard: After that, all I did was check out his profile, go back in the archive of his feed until I found his Twitter handle.", "Raj: From there, it was easy to find him on Instagram, Snapchat and pretty much track his every movement.", "Howard: So if you think that\u2019s creepy, you married the wrong guy.", "Bernadette: Maybe I should marry Trent.", "Raj: Yeah, like she could get Trent.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Dave: This is delicious.", "Amy: Thank you.", "Dave: Been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal.", "Amy: When you were married, did your wife cook?", "Dave: Not at first, no. But when she began cheating on me with a French chef, she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.", "Amy: So, a little silver lining.", "Dave: I suppose. Yeah. Nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life like a properly-seasoned bowl of onion soup. How long have you, uh, lived here?", "Amy: Uh, about five years. I\u2019m actually thinking of moving to a better place now that I don\u2019t need to be so close to, well, you know.", "Dave: I do. The brilliant physicist that I now know lives in the area, not that I care.", "Amy: Yeah. Anyway, he doesn\u2019t drive, so, I pretty much had to take him everywhere.", "Dave: Had to or got to? Sorry.", "Amy: My fault. I brought him up.", "Dave: Yeah. Well, let\u2019s change the subject. No more mentions of you-know-who. That\u2019s a cool train. Where did you get that?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Bah, bam, bum-bum, bah, bum, bum. This song is never going to stop. Have you ever dealt with something so relentlessly irritating?", "Leonard: That\u2019s a trick question, right?", "Sheldon: Well, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. There\u2019s a rich history of brilliant minds descending into madness.", "Penny: Come on, Sheldon. There are plenty of smart people who don\u2019t have mental problems.", "Leonard: Yup, she\u2019s right. For every Newton who had a psychological issue, there\u2019s an Edison who was just a jerk. That could totally be you.", "Sheldon: Empedocles thought he was a god and jumped into a volcano. And Pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans. Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon who he claimed loved him back.", "Penny: Maybe he just had bread in his pocket.", "Sheldon: The list extends outside of science. Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock, chess champion Bobby Fischer, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. (Clip of Darling by the Beach Boys) I remember the song. It\u2019s called Darlin\u2019 by the Beach Boys. Oh, thank goodness. I\u2019m not crazy. I don\u2019t have to take a pigeon as my bride.", "Leonard: There goes our shot at him living on the roof.", "Scene: A coffee shop.", "Raj: So, all right, there he is. So, should we introduce ourselves?", "Howard: No. Let him spot us.", "Raj: I wonder if he\u2019s listening to our music right now.", "Howard: Could you imagine? What a cool way for us to meet. He\u2019s playing our song and looks up, and there we are, his favorite two-piece acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.", "Raj: And he\u2019s, all, like, aren\u2019t you the guys from Footprints on the Moo-oo-ooh what is he doing?!", "Howard: I can\u2019t watch.", "Raj: It\u2019s okay. Oh, it\u2019s okay. He\u2019s done.", "Howard: Why is he looking at it?", "Raj: Eh, no, he\u2019s not going to eat it, is he?", "Howard: Come on, Trent, you\u2019re better than th-ah.", "Raj: Ooh!", "Howard: Let\u2019s just go.", "Trent: Hey, aren\u2019t you the guys?", "Howard: Nope.", "Raj: No, never heard of \u2019em!", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is listening to Darlin\u2019", "Sheldon: I wonder why it was this particular song that was stuck in my head.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s pretty catchy.", "Penny: Do you even like the Beach Boys?", "Sheldon: They have beach right in the name. What do you think?", "Leonard: Well, now that you can focus again, what do you say we get back to surface tension of domain walls?", "Sheldon: Of course. I\u2019m already seeing a more efficient way of taming the ultravi\u2026 I know why the song was in my head.", "Penny: Why?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s about Amy.", "Penny: Okay, look, I know Amy\u2019s like an old lady, but she\u2019s not old enough to have a song from the sixties written about her.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s about how she made my life better. Consider the lyrics. I was living like half a man. Then I couldn\u2019t love, but now I can. More soul than I ever had. I love the way you soften my life.\u201d", "Penny: She did soften your life, didn\u2019t she?", "Sheldon: Yes. She\u2019s like the dryer sheets of my heart. I have to go.", "Leonard: Aw. Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?", "Penny: Better. You\u2019re the lint trap of my love.", "Leonard: Aw.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Amy: That\u2019s an interesting tie clip.", "Dave: Oh, thanks. It\u2019s, uh, Avogadro\u2019s constant. It\u2019s useful for calculating the number of atoms in a substance, or causing regret in anyone who asks about it.", "Amy: No, I, I think it\u2019s neat. Oh.", "Dave: Sorry. Sorry. No one\u2019s ever liked the tie clip before, so I just lost all control.", "Amy: No, it, it\u2019s okay, and we are on a date. I\u2019m, I\u2019m just a little nervous.", "Dave: Well, no need to be nervous with me. I\u2019m just a harmless giant from a foreign land.", "Amy: You know, I\u2019m just being silly. I, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m waiting for.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy?", "Amy: That\u2019s Sheldon.", "Dave: You\u2019re kidding. How\u2019s my hair?", "Amy: Sheldon, this, this isn\u2019t a good time.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t care. Amy, there was a song I couldn\u2019t get out of my head. Eventually, I realized the song was about you, and like that earworm, I can\u2019t get you out of my heart. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is, you\u2019re my heartworm. The metaphorical kind, not, not the poodle-killing kind.", "Amy: What?", "Dave: If I may, I believe what he\u2019s saying, in a charming and delightful way, is that he loves you and wants you back. Dave Gibbs, huge fan of your work. Don\u2019t mind me.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry; I didn\u2019t realize you were on a date.", "Amy: No, it, it, it\u2019s okay. Keep going?", "Sheldon: Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.", "Amy: I really want that, too.", "Sheldon: Good. Because I love you.", "Amy: I love you, too.", "Dave: Kiss her, you brilliant fool.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019ll let you get back to your date.", "Amy: Get back here.", "Dave: Okay, then. I\u2019ll, uh, see myself out. Amy, thank you for dinner. Dr. Cooper, pleasure to meet you, sir. Uh, if perhaps sometime you have a spare moment, I\u2019d, uh, love to discuss physics, or shoot the breeze, as you Yanks say. Ah. What a lovely evening."]}
