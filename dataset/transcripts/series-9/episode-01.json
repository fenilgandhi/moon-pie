Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet.", "Penny: Why would we want that?", "Leonard: \u2018Cause there\u2019s a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don\u2019t believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let\u2019s give them hope.", "Penny: Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I\u2019ve always wanted a wedding with a comment section.", "Leonard: If you\u2019re not into this, we can do it another time.", "Penny: No. No, I want to. Look, we\u2019ve put this off long enough. Let\u2019s do it.", "Leonard: Aw. That\u2019s exactly what you said the first time we slept together. (Phone) Oh, excuse me. Sheldon. Hey.", "Sheldon: Leonard, have you gotten married yet?", "Leonard: No. Why?", "Sheldon: Good. Don\u2019t do it.", "Leonard: Why not?", "Sheldon: Some important new information has come to light. Women are the worst. I thought it was paper cuts, but I was wrong. No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.", "Leonard: What happened now?", "Sheldon: Amy has ended our relationship.", "Leonard: Oh, no. Seriously?", "Penny: What\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: Amy broke up with Sheldon.", "Penny: She did?", "Sheldon: Is Penny crying?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: No, of course not. They thrive on our suffering.", "Leonard: Buddy, I\u2019m so sorry. Is there anything I can do?", "Sheldon: Yes. If I ever talk about going out with a girl again, roll your eyes at me like I do to you when you say dumb things.", "Leonard: Sheldon, uh, okay, just because you\u2019re going through this with Amy doesn\u2019t mean that all women are bad.", "Sheldon: Whatever.", "Penny (on phone): Hey, I just heard about you and Sheldon. Are you okay?", "Amy: Not really. Can you come over?", "Penny: Uh, actually I\u2019m in Vegas. Leonard and I are about to get married.", "Amy: Hold on. You\u2019re getting married and you didn\u2019t invite me?", "Penny: Well, it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.", "Amy: Wow. Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.", "Penny: Amy, don\u2019t be like that.", "Sheldon: Why did I just hear Amy\u2019s name?", "Leonard: Penny\u2019s on the phone with her.", "Sheldon: Did she say anything about me? Never mind. I don\u2019t care. Well, if you care, you can find out and tell me. Just don\u2019t be shocked when you find out that I don\u2019t care.", "Penny: Okay, will you relax? You\u2019re not missing anything special.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: She\u2019s upset. Look, it\u2019s gonna be a great wedding. Look at you in your little suit.", "Sheldon: Amy\u2019s upset? Is it about me?", "Leonard: No, I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re eloping.", "Sheldon: Your marriage is causing her pain? Yeah, great, I take it back. Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Outside Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Amy: Oh. What are you doing here?", "Sheldon: When last we spoke, you said you needed time.", "Amy: Well, it\u2019s only been 11 hours.", "Sheldon: The Lord of the Rings trilogy was nearly 11 hours. I made you watch that, you said it was an eternity.", "Amy: Sheldon, when I\u2019m ready to talk, I\u2019ll let you know.", "Sheldon: Very well. You seem to be headed somewhere. May I walk with you?", "Amy: Sure.", "Sheldon: Boy, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re going out again.", "Amy: We\u2019re not back together.", "Sheldon: Why? Is there someone else? Just couldn\u2019t wait for that first notch on your bedpost, could you?", "Amy: If you must know, I\u2019m going to Howard and Bernadette\u2019s to watch the wedding.", "Sheldon: And who\u2019s this guy you\u2019re taking?", "Amy: There\u2019s no guy.", "Sheldon: Oh, you\u2019re going to a wedding alone? That\u2019s sad.", "Amy: I\u2019m not gonna be alone. I\u2019ll be with my friends.", "Sheldon: Your friends? Well, I think you mean my friends. And why wasn\u2019t I invited to this?", "Amy: Maybe because the two of us being there would make them feel awkward.", "Sheldon: We make everyone feel awkward. That\u2019s our thing.", "Scene: The Wedding Chapel. ", "Leonard: They\u2019re running a little behind. Should be pretty soon.", "Penny: Okay.", "Leonard: Hey, if you\u2019re hungry, there\u2019s a breakfast buffet at the strip club next door.", "Penny: Thanks, but I don\u2019t like glitter on my scrambled eggs.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t think the strippers prepare the meal, but okay. Look, it\u2019s not how I pictured it either, but I\u2019m still glad we\u2019re doing it.", "Penny: Me, too.", "Leonard: You sure?", "Penny: Yes.", "Leonard: And you promise you\u2019re okay with everything from the car?", "Penny: Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?", "Leonard: You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. We have the rest of our lives to dredge stuff up from the past and fight about it. So what do you think? Should we run next door and grab a bite?", "Penny: What if they call our names?", "Leonard: Oh, don\u2019t worry. They gave me this vibrating coaster.", "Penny: Oh, and the fairy tale continues.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s House.", "Amy: Thank you for doing this.", "Bernadette: Our pleasure. You feeling okay?", "Amy: We were together for so long, I honestly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling.", "Howard: Well, that\u2019s understandable. You forgot. It\u2019s called happy.", "Bernadette: Howard.", "Howard: I\u2019m not saying anything bad. Just that she was in love with her captor and somehow managed to escape from his dark and crazy dungeon.", "Stuart: I know what you\u2019re going through. My, my, my last breakup was pretty tough.", "Amy: Oh. What was her name?", "Stuart: Hey, it\u2019s a true story. I don\u2019t need the third degree.", "Bernadette: For God\u2019s sake, Sheldon, what are you doing?", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t want to come in. I was told it would make everyone feel uncomfortable. So I\u2019ll just stay out here and pretend that I don\u2019t have to go to the bathroom.", "Bernadette: Howard, do something.", "Howard: I\u2019m on it.", "Amy: Sheldon, you being here might not be making things better.", "Sheldon: I see. And is that why everybody was invited but me?", "Amy: They didn\u2019t invite everybody but you.Bernadette invited me, and Stuart lives here.", "Raj: Who wants hot cinnamon rolls?", "Scene: The Wedding Chapel.", "Official: So, when you hear the music, that\u2019s your cue. Any questions?", "Leonard: Oh, the package that we paid for said the aisle was supposed to be strewn with rose petals.", "Official: Where are the rose petals?!", "Female Voice We\u2019re out", "Leonard: You know what? It\u2019s fine.", "Female Voice: We can use the potpourri from the bathroom!", "Penny: Really, we\u2019re good.", "Leonard: Yup, just want to get married.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Official: Great. I\u2019ll see you two up there.", "Leonard: This is it.", "Penny: I know.", "Leonard: I love you.", "Penny: I love you, too.", "Female Voice: Was that a yes or no on the potpourri?", "Penny: No, thank you.", "Leonard: We\u2019re good.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s House.", "Sheldon: Raj, you\u2019re probably wondering why Amy and I aren\u2019t showing any affection to one another.", "Raj: Didn\u2019t even crack the top ten.", "Sheldon: Well, you should know that she recently broke up with me.", "Amy: I said I needed time to think.", "Raj: I\u2019m sure you guys will figure something out.", "Sheldon: You hear that? Raj is devastated.", "Bernadette: Sheldon, shh. The wedding\u2019s starting.", "Sheldon: I see what\u2019s happening. Sides are forming. Well, if Bernadette\u2019s on Amy\u2019s team, I pick Howard.", "Howard: I\u2019m not taking sides.", "Sheldon: Fine, I guess I\u2019m stuck with Raj.", "Raj: Really?", "Stuart: At least you got picked.", "Scene: The Wedding Chapel.", "Official: Before I go any further, have either of you prepared your own vows?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Penny: No. You wrote vows?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Penny: Well, I don\u2019t have any. You\u2019re kind of making me look bad.", "Leonard: It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t have to say them.", "Penny: No, no, no, go ahead. I\u2019ll come up with something mushy, you\u2019ll cry, we got this.", "Leonard: Penny, we are made of particles that have existed since the moment the universe began. I like to think those atoms travelled 14 billion years through time and space to create us, so that we could be together and make each other whole.", "Penny: Wow.", "Official: Penny?", "Penny: Right. Um, okay. Leonard, I mean, you\u2019re not only the love of my life. I mean, you\u2019re my best friend, and, you\u2019ve got a friend in me. You got troubles. I got \u2019em, too. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for you. We stick together, and we can see it through, \u2019cause you\u2019ve got a friend in me.", "Official: Is that the song from Toy Story?", "Penny: He loves that movie.", "Leonard: I do.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Bernadette: Aw, that was beautiful.", "Howard: Yeah. I mean, not like our wedding beautiful.", "Bernadette: No, we totally won.", "Sheldon: Amy, I don\u2019t understand, are we broken up or not? It\u2019s like you can\u2019t make up your mind.", "Amy: It\u2019s because you\u2019re not giving me any space to think.", "Sheldon: Well, you should think fast, because men can sire offspring their entire lives, but those eggs you\u2019re toting around have a sell-by date.", "Amy: You know what, Sheldon, you\u2019ve made this really easy. You\u2019re immature, you\u2019re selfish, you just insulted me to my face. I don\u2019t need any more time to think. We\u2019re broken up.", "Bernadette: Amy.", "Sheldon: Will someone take me home?", "Raj: Yeah. Come on, I\u2019ll give you a ride.", "Official (voice from computer) \u2026symbolizes your eternal love.

Hang on. I believe I\u2019m supposed to carry you across the threshold.", "Penny: Can you?", "Leonard: Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed when he falls asleep in front of the TV?", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s do it. You gonna make it?", "Leonard: I\u2019m okay.", "Penny: Nicely done.", "Leonard: Thank you. Finally, there\u2019s a Mrs. Hofstadter who isn\u2019t disappointed in me.", "Penny: Well, the night is still young.", "Leonard: Everything all right?", "Penny: Yeah. I guess.", "Leonard: Just tell me.", "Penny: It\u2019s just, when we were kissing, I couldn\u2019t help but picture you with that other girl.", "Leonard: Oh, no. No, come on. I have a friend in you. You said so.", "Penny: You\u2019re right. Just forget it.", "Leonard: Yeah. Okay, listen. If you\u2019re imagining that it was sexy, it wasn\u2019t. We, we were both drunk, and she smelled like an ashtray. The boat was moving a lot, so I chipped her tooth.", "Penny: Did you feel guilty?", "Leonard: No, she had dental insurance.", "Penny: Did you feel guilty after kissing her?", "Leonard: Yes. I felt guilty as soon as it happened. I feel guilty every time I see her.", "Penny: What do you mean, every time you see her?", "Leonard: What do I mean? Boy, that\u2019s a toughie.", "Penny: You still see her?", "Leonard: Well, no, not socially. But, you know, just at work.", "Penny: You work with her? How could you not tell me that?", "Leonard: I wanted to tell you in the car, but you told me to stop talking", "Penny: Oh, okay. So you\u2019re saying this is my fault?", "Leonard: No, of course not. Okay, look, instead of fighting, why don\u2019t we dim the lights, um, get naked and make a baby? I was trying to lighten the mood. It\u2019s not easy. You try it.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon (on phone): Hello, Mother.", "Mrs Cooper: Shelly! How\u2019s my baby doing?", "Sheldon: I just wanted to let you know that you can remove Amy from your nightly prayers. Unless you\u2019re open to praying for a beehive to fall on her head.", "Mrs Cooper: Oh, what\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: She broke up with me.", "Mrs Cooper: Oh, Shelly.", "Sheldon: No, I\u2019ll be okay. But I think that I\u2019d like to send the ring back to you.", "Mrs Cooper: Well, let\u2019s not be hasty. Are you sure it\u2019s over for good?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s over for me. I\u2019m done with women. Like when I swore off Pop Rocks. They both hurt you on purpose.", "Mrs Cooper: You want to tell me what happened?", "Sheldon: Are you going to say it\u2019s all part of God\u2019s plan?", "Mrs Cooper: Good chance.", "Sheldon: Then no, thank you.", "Mrs Cooper: Well, honey, don\u2019t send it back yet. Your sister\u2019s married, and I\u2019m not letting your brother give my grandmother\u2019s ring to that whore he\u2019s dating.", "Sheldon: Wasn\u2019t Mary Magdalene a woman of ill repute?", "Mrs Cooper: When your idiot brother redeems mankind, he can date whoever he wants.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Bernadette: I know it hurts now, but it\u2019s gonna get better.", "Amy: Yeah.", "Howard: Everything\u2019s gonna be okay.", "Stuart: You\u2019ve got so much to offer.", "Amy: Thank you.", "Stuart: Any man would be lucky to have you.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s true.", "Amy: I just hope I did the right thing.", "Stuart: I\u2019m sure you did. Maybe that\u2019s the problem, you always do the right thing. Maybe it\u2019s time to do the wrong thing.", "Amy: Like you\u2019re doing right now?", "Stuart: Exactly.", "Scene: The stairwell. ", "Leonard: I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren\u2019t?", "Penny: I thought I was okay, but it turns out I\u2019m not.", "Leonard: Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift.", "Sheldon: Wow. Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not glowing. I\u2019m upset.", "Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon (outside): Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny? Knock, knock, knock, Penny?", "Penny: What\u2019s this?", "Sheldon: Leonard told me what happened, so I took it upon myself to make you a hot beverage.", "Penny: Oh. That\u2019s so sweet of you.", "Sheldon: Yeah. I know. Turns out, being sweet isn\u2019t enough to keep a girl these days. I blame Madonna.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry to hear about you and Amy.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry about Leonard. Thought I raised him better than that.", "Penny: You know, it\u2019s bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.", "Sheldon: He does? Who is it?", "Penny: Some girl named Mandy.", "Sheldon: Mandy Chao?", "Penny: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Oh, you don\u2019t need to worry about her. She\u2019s brilliant and attractive. She can do way better", "than Leonard.", "Penny: That\u2019s great.", "Sheldon: Wait a minute. I know this may sound far fetched, but I\u2019m on the market now. You know, if I dated Mandy, that would teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.", "Penny: That\u2019s ridiculous.", "Sheldon: Oh, you\u2019re right. I could never be with a woman whose self-esteem was so low she\u2019d be with Leonard.", "Penny: I\u2019m with Leonard.", "Sheldon: Yeah, I know. Forever. Who would have believed these things would happen to us?", "Penny: Right? I can\u2019t believe Amy actually went through with it.", "Sheldon: Hang on. You knew that she was going to end it with me? Did you try and stop her?", "Penny: I told her to be true to herself and do what makes her happy.", "Sheldon: Do what makes her happy? She plays the harp and her car is paid for. How much happier can she be?", "Penny: Okay, look, it\u2019s not my fault that she thought you were a bad boyfriend.", "Sheldon: I see. Well, I think I\u2019ll be going.", "Penny: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: No, no, no, no. We are done here. Would you mind opening the door and then angrily slamming it behind me?", "Penny: Sure.", "Sheldon: Thank you. And slam it hard, because I am pretty steamed.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Howard (on phone): All right, Leonard, hang in there. Talk to you tomorrow.", "Bernadette: What happened? They just got married.", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.", "Bernadette: Think they\u2019ll break up?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Sounds pretty bad. Penny\u2019s back in her apartment all by herself.", "Stuart: Really?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?", "Leonard: Sure, let\u2019s make it an even hundred.", "Sheldon: You would never kiss me and make me say I love you and then break up with me.", "Leonard: I wouldn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: And you know why? \u2018Cause you\u2019re a man. The champagne of genders.", "Leonard: Well, I may be a man, but I think I\u2019m the one that screwed up on this one.", "Sheldon: Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man. All you hear women say is, I\u2019ll just have a salad. You know? Where\u2019s my lip gloss? I think this element should be called radium. That last one was Madame Curie.", "Leonard: I figured that out.", "Sheldon: You know what? She was kind of an honorary man. She had a penis made of science.", "Leonard: Can\u2019t believe I\u2019m spending my wedding night with you.", "Sheldon: Really? I never imagined it any other way.", "\u00a0"]}
