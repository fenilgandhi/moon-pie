{"series": "7", "episode": "16", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment", "Howard: I\u2019m thinking about growing a goatee.", "Raj: Oh, actually that\u2019s a Van Dyke. A goatee is just hair on the chin.", "Leonard: Oh. Wait, then what is it if you just have hair up here?", "Raj: You mean a moo-stache?", "Leonard: Moo-stache.", "Howard: He said it.", "Raj: Ha-ha, very funny. Make fun of the foreign guy. For your information, there are four times as many Indians as there are Americans, so the way we say it is right.", "Howard: Say what?", "Raj: Moo-stache.", "Leonard: Moo-stache.", "Howard: He said it.", "Bernadette: Guys, you\u2019re being childish.", "Sheldon: Yeah, she\u2019s right. You\u2019re grown men, the kind who are perfectly capable of growing your own moo-staches.", "Amy: Hey, you were funny on purpose, good job.", "Penny: Hi. Sorry I\u2019m late, I was at an audition.", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019m sorry.", "Sheldon: You\u2019ll get \u2019em next time.", "Penny: How about instead of assuming I failed, you ask me how it went?", "Leonard: Sorry. How did it go?", "Penny: Just shut up.", "Raj: Here, you can have your seat.", "Penny: No, no, no, stay there. I\u2019m fine on the floor.", "Bernadette: Have you guys ever thought about getting a dining room table?", "Amy: Yeah. You actually do have room for one up there.", "Raj: Oh, sure, I sit on the floor for years, no one cares. The pretty white girl\u2019s there ten seconds, and suddenly we\u2019re all running to IKEA.", "Sheldon: No one is running anywhere. We\u2019re not getting a dining room table.", "Leonard: I know you don\u2019t like change, but it\u2019s not a terrible idea.", "Penny: Yeah, you guys never use that space up there. Why not get a table?", "Sheldon: Do you want the long answer or the short answer?", "Howard: Hey, how come we never get that option?", "Sheldon: Chaos theory suggests that even in a deterministic system, if the equations describing its behaviour are non-linear, a tiny change in the initial conditions can lead to a cataclysmic and unpredictable result.", "Penny: Translation?", "Leonard: Waah. I don\u2019t want a table.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Hey, Penny and I are gonna go shop for a dining room table. You want to come with us?", "Sheldon: You know, I\u2019d love to, but, um, I\u2019m too busy falling back in love with Windows 98.", "Leonard: Seriously? You haven\u2019t used this desk in years. The second I want to get rid of it, you\u2019re up here working?", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t talk right now, I have several thousand updates to install.", "Leonard: Are you really gonna sit here all day?", "Sheldon: Think of me as Arthur Dent in Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy, lying in front of the bulldozers to protect his home.", "Leonard: If you\u2019ll recall, the Vogon fleet blew up the Earth anyway.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a made-up story, Leonard, I don\u2019t even know why you\u2019re talking about it.", "Leonard: I\u2019m putting all this stuff in storage. We don\u2019t need any of it.", "Sheldon: You, how can you say that? You show me one thing in here we can live without.", "Leonard: Oh, hang on. Check your in-box.", "Sheldon: Wait. Is this really worth it? We\u2019ve lived together for years with nary an argument.", "Leonard: Huh?", "Sheldon: But we start talking about a table, and suddenly we\u2019re at each other\u2019s throats.", "Leonard: Nary an argument? Nary?", "Sheldon: Well, that means not one, or not any. Maybe instead of a table, you should buy a dictionary. Well, I don\u2019t know if I won that, but at least he\u2019s upset.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: Check it out.", "Raj: Magic wand TV remote?", "Howard: Yeah, I can control all sorts of stuff.", "Raj: Did Bernadette think it was cool?", "Howard: Not when I said mute and pointed it at her face.", "Raj: Oh, uh, let me try. Uh, channelis changeroni. This might be my second favorite brown magic wand.", "Howard: Well, that\u2019s the last time I play with that. (Phone rings) I have to take this. Hello? 00:04:24,137", "Raj: Uh, off. And on. And the Oprah Network. This is so much better than watching TV like a muggle.", "Howard: Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll be in touch. You\u2019re not gonna believe this.", "Raj: What\u2019s going on? Oh. Wait. On. And off. What\u2019s going on?", "Howard: That was NASA. They want me to go back up to the space station.", "Raj: Wow. What did you tell them?", "Howard: I told them I\u2019d be honoured.", "Raj: A second trip to space, I\u2019ll miss you.", "Howard: And I\u2019m gonna miss you, too.", "Raj: And I just want you to know, I\u2019m happy to look in on Bernadette while you\u2019re gone.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Raj: And if anything were to happen to you, we will name our first born son Howard. I\u2019m just kidding. We\u2019ll name him Dalib, after my grandfather.", "Scene: A furniture store.", "Penny: Ooh, this one looks nice.", "Leonard: No. Sheldon doesn\u2019t like reclaimed wood.", "Penny: Why not?", "Leonard: He\u2019s afraid the original owners will come back.", "Penny: Yeah. Well, Sheldon\u2019s not here.", "Leonard: Well, he is here. So unless you want to dig him out with a bone saw and a melon baller, there\u2019s nothing I can do about it.", "Penny: All right, sweetie, you\u2019re paying for this table, and it\u2019s your apartment, too.", "Leonard: I know, but\u2026", "Penny: No buts. You got to stop letting him boss you around.", "Leonard: You\u2019re right. I mean, he decides what TV shows we watch, what food we eat, who my favourite hobbit is. I wanted Frodo, but we can\u2019t both have Frodo, so guess who\u2019s stuck with Samwise Gamgee.", "Penny: See? Right there. You\u2019re a grown man, you should be able to pick whichever hobbit you want. Wish you wouldn\u2019t, but one problem at a time.", "Leonard: You make a lot of sense. I like this table, and I\u2019m getting it.", "Penny: Really? This one?", "Leonard: That one? Damn right I like that one.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Hey.", "Howard: Good news. Someone in this room gets to take a ride on a rocket.", "Bernadette: Fine. Can I at least shower first?", "Howard: No, not that. Although you already agreed to it, so no take-backs.", "Bernadette: What are you talking about?", "Howard: Sit down. NASA called. The telescope mount I installed on the space station got damaged, and they want me to go back up and fix it.", "Bernadette: Wow. Well, what did you say?", "Howard: What do you think I said? I said yes. Why do you look surprised?", "Bernadette: Well, it\u2019s just, after last time, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d ever want to go back.", "Howard: Are you kidding? It was the greatest experience of my life.", "Bernadette: Really? \u2018Cause I kind of remember a lot of complaining and wishing for it to be over.", "Howard: I think you have me confused with what\u2019s gonna happen when you get out of that shower.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Hey, all set. What do you think? There\u2019s plenty of room for everybody, a view out the window.", "Sheldon: My spot on the couch has a great view of a window. Sometimes I can see space battles through it. It\u2019s called a TV.", "Penny: Give it a chance, Sheldon, you might actually like it.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re absolutely right. Nope.", "Penny: Well, you can\u2019t say he didn\u2019t give it a fair shot.", "Sheldon: So, when can we get rid of it?", "Leonard: We\u2019re not.", "Sheldon: What about the roommate agreement? It specifically states that any changes in furnishing have to be approved by the Furnishing Committee. Which only sits on alternate years. Yeah, and by the way, it sits over there.", "Penny: Come on, that is ridiculous.", "Leonard: She\u2019s right, a committee that important should meet more often.", "Penny: That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.", "Leonard: Oh. This is the thing about me standing up to him and not letting him run my life?", "Penny: Yes.", "Leonard: That.", "Sheldon: Okay. I think we\u2019ve found the problem here. It\u2019s not the table at all. It\u2019s you.", "Penny: Me?", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s always me, take one for the team.", "Sheldon: I have spent years turning this lump of clay into an acceptable conduit for my will, and then you came along and reshaped him, with your newfangled ideas and your fancy genitals.", "Penny: Are you gonna let him talk to me like this?", "Leonard: Fancy sounds like a compliment.", "Penny: Okay, I have not tried to change Leonard. That\u2019s just what happens in relationships. Look how much Amy\u2019s changed you.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s not true.", "Penny: Oh, please. When I first met you, you were incapable of touching another human being. Now you\u2019re holding hands, you\u2019re going on dates, you even made out with her on a train.", "Sheldon: She told you?", "Penny: Of course she told me, it\u2019s the most interesting thing that\u2019s ever happened to her in her entire life.", "Leonard: You\u2019re too close to it, but Amy has had a huge impact on you.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right. Without realizing it, I\u2019ve allowed that woman to alter my personality.", "Leonard: Mm, Sheldon, you didn\u2019t have a personality, you just had some shows you liked.", "Sheldon: No. No, I\u2019ve changed. Like the frog who\u2019s put in a pot of water that\u2019s heated so gradually he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s boiling to death.", "Penny: Or you\u2019re the frog who\u2019s been kissed by a princess and turned into a prince.", "Leonard: Or you\u2019re just a tall, annoying frog.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. I have to break up with my girlfriend.", "Penny: Oh, Sheldon, wait.", "Sheldon: No. You\u2019ve opened my eyes to the truth. Amy has made me a more affectionate, open-minded person. And that stops now.", "Leonard: Well, we should call her.", "Penny: Yeah, mm-hmm. Amy, it\u2019s Penny. Hey. Just a little heads-up. Leonard bought a dining room table. Yeah. Sheldon\u2019s breaking up with you.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? (Knock, knock, knock) Amy? I\u2019ll get right to the point. I think we need to end this relationship, so just sign this with your finger, and, uh, please don\u2019t cry on my iPad, I didn\u2019t get AppleCare.", "Amy: I\u2019m not surprised you want to end the relationship. I\u2019m a little surprised you didn\u2019t get AppleCare. Anyway, enjoy your life. Where do I sign?", "Sheldon: At the bottom. I must say, I\u2019m relieved you\u2019re not making more of a scene out of this.", "Amy: Oh, I\u2019ve already moved on. Besides, this breakup has nothing to do with me.", "Sheldon: It doesn\u2019t?", "Amy: Of course not. This is just Leonard trying to take the focus off that dreadful table by sowing discord in our relationship. He\u2019s manipulating you like he always does.", "Sheldon: Wait, wait, now, hang on. You think he manipulates me?", "Amy: All the time. And he knew that, as your girlfriend, I wasn\u2019t gonna stand by and let him bring a table into your apartment. I mean, a table? Come on?", "Sheldon: It is hideous.", "Amy: Well, thankfully, I won\u2019t have to see it, \u2019cause I won\u2019t be your girlfriend anymore. Amy Farrah Fowler. Why, yes, I would like to take a survey.", "Sheldon: Wait. You were really gonna stand by me against the dining room table?", "Amy: Of course I was.", "Sheldon: Wait. How do I know that you\u2019re not manipulating me right now?", "Amy: I think if I were manipulating you, you\u2019d be smart enough to see it.", "Sheldon: How do I know you\u2019re not saying that as part of the manipulation?", "Amy: I think you\u2019d be smart enough to see that, too.", "Sheldon: Okay. I\u2019m sorry I gave you such a hard time, I just had to be sure.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: It\u2019s pretty exciting that NASA wants to send Howard back up.", "Bermadette: Yeah, exciting. Can I ask you something?", "Raj: Course.", "Bernadette: He hated that entire experience. Does it make me an awful wife if I don\u2019t think he should do it again?", "Raj: Not at all. He\u2019s forgotten how miserable he was the entire time he was up there. It\u2019s like me in those moments when I miss India.", "Bernadette: So you\u2019ll talk to him?", "Raj: Why me?", "Bernadette: Well, I\u2019m his wife, I don\u2019t want to ruin it for him.", "Raj: That\u2019s the dynamic, I\u2019m the fun one, you\u2019re the buzzkill.", "Bernadette: Since when am I the buzzkill?", "Raj: Do you think this is cool?", "Bernadette: No, I think it\u2019s stupid.", "Raj: Aha.", "Bernadette: You\u2019re right, it\u2019s great.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Leonard: Oh, hey. You guys didn\u2019t break up.", "Sheldon: No. Sorry to disappoint you, but Amy pointed out that you were only trying to manipulate me.", "Amy: Which you also figured out by yourself.", "Sheldon: Which I also figured out by myself.", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re still together.", "Sheldon: Yeah, okay, you can stop trying to make this about our relationship.", "Amy: Which is stronger than ever.", "Sheldon: Which is stronger than ever. This is about you trying to change my environment, which was perfect the way it was.", "Howard: But it got the way it was through change. The-the-the spot that you love to sit in, that no one else can sit in, only exists because, despite your objections. I bought this couch. Me. So explain why that change was bad and this change was good.", "Sheldon: Um.", "Amy: You don\u2019t need to explain yourself to him.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t need to explain myself to you!", "Amy: You\u2019re sick of his nonsense and ready to move in with me.", "Sheldon: Keep the table. We don\u2019t use that space.", "Amy: Damn it, I got cocky.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: Hey, Bernie. I\u2019m home. Hello.", "Bernadette: Hi, honey.", "Howard: What\u2019s going on?", "Bernadette: Maybe you should have a seat.", "Howard: Um, okay. I know my mom\u2019s not dead, there\u2019d be balloons.", "Raj: Um, okay. First off, know that we all love you and cherish you.", "Mike Rostenkowski: Well, I wouldn\u2019t\u2026", "Bernadette: Daddy.", "Mike R: You\u2019re great.", "Mike Massimino (on skype): Can I say something?", "Raj: Oh, of course.", "Mike M: Hey, Fruit Loops.", "Howard: Massimino? Why are you here?", "Mike M: Well, I heard you were thinking about going back up to the space station, and as someone who\u2019s been there with you, well, you know how astronauts need to have the right stuff?", "Howard: Sure.", "Mike M: The stuff you have is wrong.", "Howard: You don\u2019t think I did a good job up there?", "Mike M: You did a fine job. It\u2019s just, you were scared and miserable the whole time.", "Bernadette: I think what we\u2019re all trying to say is, you don\u2019t seem to be remembering how traumatic the experience was for you.", "Raj: Like how women often forget the pain of childbirth.", "Mike R: Like a woman. Great analogy.", "Howard: Fine, maybe I was a little scared.", "Mike M: You peed in your space suit.", "Howard: You\u2019re supposed to do that.", "Mike M: Not during the fitting.", "Mike R: Son, do I need to remind you what you asked me to do before you went up last time?", "Howard: Hang on. That was just me joking around.", "Mike R: You wanted me to shoot you in the foot.", "Howard: Come on, how is that not a joke? You got to get me out of this. Shoot me in the foot.", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t forget all the other astronauts picking on you.", "Raj: And how you threw up in zero gravity, and it floated back in your mouth. And you threw up again. And so on and so on.", "Mike M: That was funny.", "Howard: Okay, so I wasn\u2019t exactly John Glenn up there, but I\u2019ve changed. I\u2019m a different man now. Yeah, and I\u2019m a little insulted that you guys don\u2019t think I can handle it.", "Mike M: You know you\u2019re gonna have to go through survival training again.", "Howard: Really?", "Scene: A doctor\u2019s surgery.", "Howard: You\u2019ve got to get me out of this.", "Doctor: What do you want me to do? You\u2019re perfectly healthy.", "Howard: Check my blood pressure again. I can get it higher. just give me a second. (Dials phone) ", "Mrs Wolowitz (on phone): Hello?", "Howard: Hi, Ma. How are you?", "Mrs Wolowitz: How I am is not dead, but you wouldn\u2019t know that, because you don\u2019t love me enough to pick up the phone.", "Howard: Go, go, go.", "Mrs Wolowitz: For all you know, I could have slipped in the tub and drowned. That\u2019s what happened to your Aunt Ida.", "Doctor: Wow.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Howard, I\u2019m so sorry your blood pressure was off the charts.", "Howard: Oh, me, too. I mean, the doctor was willing to fudge the results, but it just seemed so darned dishonest.", "Leonard: But the mission wouldn\u2019t be for at least a year. Isn\u2019t that enough time to get your blood pressure under\u2026", "Howard: Look, my blood pressure\u2019s too high, okay? Drop it.", "Penny: You know, my aunt changed her diet, and in a few months, she\u2026", "Howard: Went to space? I don\u2019t think so. Now, pass the soy sauce. Hey, not the green one, the red one.", "Penny: Sheldon, Amy, will you please come join us?", "Bernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s fun up here.", "Leonard: So why are you trying to ruin it?", "Sheldon: No, thanks. We\u2019re fine. I mean, if you people want to eat at the table, then that\u2019s what you should do. I like eating down here because this is how we\u2019ve always done things. But if those days are gone, they\u2019re gone. It just makes me sad.", "Bernadette: Now I feel bad.", "Leonard: Oh, don\u2019t anthropomorphize him, he\u2019s got big eyes, but his feelings are not like ours.", "Bernadette: No, it just seems silly for us to sit in two groups.", "Leonard: Well, it\u2019s not silly if you think of that group as being led by a big, evil baby.", "Bernadette: Look at Amy down there. Should we go?", "Penny: Yeah, let\u2019s go.", "Leonard: But Penny, this was your idea. You said that I should stand up to him.", "Penny: Forget it, Leonard. It\u2019s over.", "Leonard: Fine.", "Amy: Rajesh?", "Raj: Screw that! I sat on the floor for seven years. I\u2019m staying right here.", "Bernadette: Come on, Raj, it\u2019s not the same without you.", "Raj: Fine. But no more making fun of how I say tings.", "Howard: You mean tings like moo-stache?", "Sheldon: Well, isn\u2019t this nice. Sometimes the baby wins."]}
