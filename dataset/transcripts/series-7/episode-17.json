{"series": "7", "episode": "17", "transcript": ["Sceme: The apartment", "Bernadette: Raj, your tag\u2019s sticking out.", "Raj: Thank you. That was the closest I\u2019ve come to sex in, like, two years.", "Bernadette: Now I feel a little gross.", "Raj: You\u2019re only making it seem more real for me.", "Howard: Hey, that\u2019s my wife. If anyone\u2019s gonna make her feel gross about sex, it\u2019s me.", "Raj: Can we please talk about something other than my depressing love life?", "Sheldon: How about Penny\u2019s depressing acting career?", "Leonard: Hey. I mean, it\u2019s been a little tough, but Penny\u2019s following her dreams, and in my book, that is not depressing.", "Penny: Aw, thank you.", "Howard: Is that book called Lies I Tell to Get Sex?", "Raj: Is that a real book? I would totally read that book.", "Amy: Can I borrow it when you\u2019re done?", "Penny: Well, I\u2019ll have you guys know I turned down a part in a movie last week.", "Leonard: Why would you do that?", "Penny: Because it was crap. It\u2019s a sequel to that awful killer gorilla movie I was in.", "Bernadette: Serial Ape-ist? I thought you died in that.", "Sheldon: She does. 42 minutes in.", "Raj: While showering topless, 16 minutes after brief side butt during a pillow fight with her sorority sisters.", "Sheldon: I have an eidetic memory. I don\u2019t know what his problem is.", "Penny: Okay, well, there are no shower scenes in this one. They just try to clone me from my corpse, but my DNA gets mixed with the ape\u2019s DNA and I end up running around with giant gorilla hands and feet.", "Sheldon: Am I missing something, or isn\u2019t that the part she was born to play?", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: So are you really not gonna do this movie?", "Penny: Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the kind of part that\u2019s good for my career.", "Leonard: Well, but don\u2019t a lot of famous actors get their start doing bad movies?", "Penny: Okay, I don\u2019t think Meryl Streep ever had to say \u201cMust keep gorilla hands from killing again!\u201d", "Raj: If she did, it would be amazing. That woman can do no wrong.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know anything about show business, so if you think it\u2019s reasonable to turn down paid work and just burn through your savings, I\u2019m sure you know what you\u2019re doing.", "Amy: I think we\u2019re gonna go.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? We were making fun of failed careers. We didn\u2019t get to tap the juicy vein that is Howard\u2019s.", "Howard: Hey, I work at the same university you do.", "Sheldon: Yes, and Hawkeye\u2019s in the Avengers, but no one ever says help, Hawkeye.", "Bernadette: Can I ask you something? Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband?", "Penny: Oh, I\u2019m sure he does it out of love. The same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible about my life choices.", "Amy: I think we\u2019re gonna go.", "Leonard: No, no, no. This is not a fight. I was just excited that someone offered you a part and a little surprised that you\u2019d rather sit at home and do nothing than take it. Now it\u2019s a fight.", "Sheldon: Well, with that sorted out, I\u2019m happy to answer your question, Bernadette. Howard started it.", "Howard: I didn\u2019t do anything. I was just sitting here.", "Sheldon: I wasn\u2019t referring to this evening. Ten years ago, upon first seeing me, your husband claimed that I looked like C-3PO and Pee-wee Herman. And he called me C-3P-wee Herman.", "Raj: Ha-a-a. Still funny.", "Bernadette: That was ten years ago.", "Sheldon: Nine years, 11 months and three weeks ago, he followed that up by replacing the slides for my lecture with photographs of nude fat women bending over.", "Amy: Really?", "Howard: The lecture was on cosmic gas clouds. That\u2019s funny.", "Raj: I was there. It was funny.", "Sheldon: In any event, that began a decade-long progression of insults, pranks and unwanted magazine subscriptions. To this day, I still get a monthly copy of Granny on Granny. Which, other than its surprisingly fun puzzle page, is complete filth.", "Scene: The street", "Amy: Thanks for walking me to my car.", "Raj: Actually, it\u2019s for both of us. Last night, I watched West Side Story, and I\u2019m a little freaked out by street gangs.", "Amy: Why can\u2019t Raj find a girl? The mystery continues.", "Raj: I don\u2019t appreciate your sarcasm, but we\u2019ve still got two blocks to go, so I\u2019ll put up with it.", "Amy: Whatever happened with your online dating?", "Raj: No one was writing me back, so I stopped checking my profile.", "Amy: Before I met Sheldon, I was ready to give up, too. Once, I even dropped in on my OBGYN just to get some human contact.", "Raj: It has been a while since I got my prostate checked.", "Amy: Then I met Sheldon and look at where we are now.", "Raj: What? You\u2019ve kissed, like, once in three years.", "Amy: That\u2019s true. Do whatever you want.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Howard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Howard: Listen, I was thinking you and I could probably try to be better friends.", "Sheldon: Really? I was thinking what we have now is a bit much.", "Howard: Seriously, I was talking to Bernadette last night and she made some great points. You and I have known each other a long time, and I didn\u2019t hear the rest \u2019cause she took her bra off.", "Sheldon: Very well. How do you propose we move forward?", "Howard: Uh, for starters, we could stop insulting each other.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s a great idea. And in the spirit of our new arrangement, I will mask my surprise that you came up with it.", "Howard: Anyway, I got invited to do a little talk at NASA in Houston this weekend. They gave me two tickets. Bernadette can\u2019t go. You want to come with me? You can visit your mom, and I\u2019ll show you around the space centre.", "Sheldon: I have one question. Is this a prank where we land in Houston and you\u2019ve made up wanted posters that have my face with a moustache and a Spanish name and then I get arrested and deported to South America?", "Howard: No.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m glad because I would not have seen that coming.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s lab.", "Raj: Amy, I could use some help.", "Amy: Oh. Let me guess. There\u2019s an undergrad in a leather jacket snapping his fingers by the water fountain.", "Raj: I thought about what you said last night, and I went back on the dating Web site and I was looking at this girl\u2019s profile. She\u2019s amazing.", "Amy: Oh, she\u2019s cute. And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.", "Raj: And judging by her lack of Adam\u2019s apple, she\u2019s been female her entire life. I like that in a woman.", "Amy: Great, so what do you need me for?", "Raj: Well, I was up all night trying to write to her, but I wanted to run it by you first.", "Amy: All right.", "Raj: Emily, your face is like a precious dew-kissed flower.", "Amy: Wow.", "Raj: I know. Powerful stuff, huh?", "Amy: No. You\u2019re supposed to be yourself, not all desperate and creepy.", "Raj: Okay, I\u2019m getting some mixed messages here.", "Amy: Just say something normal like, I saw your profile. Looks like we have a lot in common, let\u2019s get a cup of coffee sometime.\u201d", "Raj: Yes. Where I can be jealous of the cup touching your ruby lips. Or you just write it for me.", "Amy: I\u2019m not gonna pretend to be you.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want you to pretend to be me. You can be like my, uh, online wingman. Like if we met her at a bar and you talked me up.", "Amy: Well, what would I say to her?", "Raj: Just tell her what I\u2019m really like. And, if you think it\u2019ll help, that you saw me changing once and my package reminded you of the muscular tail of a jaguar. Use your own words.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: Thanks again for taking me to the pharmacy.", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s no problem. Is everything okay?", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just some, uh, stomach medication for my trip. There\u2019s the remote yet distinct possibility that I may end up in South America.", "Penny: Remember the old days when I would\u2019ve said something dumb like why? Uh, that doesn\u2019t sound good.", "Sheldon: Remember the old days when I used to point out that your check engine light was on?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Well, get ready to stroll down memory lane. Penny, your check engine\u2026", "Penny: Yeah, I know it\u2019s on, Sheldon. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I cannot afford this right now.", "Sheldon: Maybe it\u2019s just something minor. Ooh, good news, the light just went out.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Are we playing individual or teams?", "Raj: Teams are fun.", "Sheldon: Oh, in that case, I\u2019d like to be partnered with my good friend Howard.", "Raj: But I\u2019m always on Howard\u2019s team. We\u2019re best friends. The kind who finish each others\u2026", "Howard: I really don\u2019t think we do tha\u2026", "Raj: Do that. See?", "Penny: Oh, hi.", "Leonard: Oh, how\u2019d it go at the mechanic?", "Penny: Not great. Can I talk to you for a sec?", "Leonard: Yeah, sure.", "Raj: Maybe I can go with you guys to Houston?", "Howard: Isn\u2019t it a little late to get plane tick\u2026", "Raj: Plane tickets? Yeah.", "Howard: Will you please sto\u2026", "Raj: Stop that? Okay.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know what to do. My car threw a rod and it\u2019s totaled. I can\u2019t afford a new one, I have no job, and now I can\u2019t drive to auditions.", "Leonard: I\u2019m so sorry. I know it\u2019s a sensitive subject, but can you reconsider that part in the movie?", "Penny: I did. I called them. The part\u2019s gone. They gave it to someone else. Now that girl\u2019s gonna get discovered and become famous and go on Letterman and talk about how she got her big break on a cheap monkey movie all because some dumb girl thought it was beneath her.", "Leonard: At least they talked about you on Letterman. Come on, I can drive you wherever you need to go.", "Penny: How? Unlike me, you have a job. I\u2019m just gonna have to go back to being a waitress, like I will be for the rest of my life.", "Sheldon: Leonard, would you wrap it up? We\u2019re waiting on you.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry, is the fact that my life\u2019s falling apart interfering with your board game?", "Sheldon: It is. You were wrong, friend Howard. She completely understood.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s lab.", "Raj: Hey, you busy?", "Amy: No. What\u2019s up?", "Raj: Have you heard back from Emily?", "Amy: I have.", "Raj: Great. And?", "Amy: And I\u2019m afraid she doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re right for her.", "Raj: I give you one simple thing to do, contact a complete stranger and make her fall in love with me, and you blow it.", "Amy: I told her what a good guy you are, but she thought it was a bad sign that you didn\u2019t write to her yourself. She thought it made you seem too shy and passive.", "Raj: I\u2019m not too shy and passive. You write her back and tell her I said that. You know, when you have a second.", "Amy: Look, I\u2019ll see if I can change her mind tomorrow night.", "Raj: What\u2019s happening tomorrow night?", "Amy: I\u2019m meeting her for coffee.", "Raj: What?", "Amy: Well, we just, we e-mailed back and forth a bit, and we kind of hit it off.", "Raj: I find a girl I like, and you\u2019re stealing her?", "Amy: No. We just ended up having a lot in common. We went to Harvard, we like Chaucer, we\u2019re both hardcore into quilting.", "Raj: Your words fall like acid rain on the wounded petals of my heart.", "Scene: Bernadette\u2019s car.", "Howard: That\u2019s Sheldon. He says he\u2019ll be down in a minute.", "Bernadette: What are you doing?", "Howard: Oh, he\u2019s not coming out until he sees proof you don\u2019t have an air freshener in your car.", "Bernadette: This is gonna be a long weekend for you.", "Howard: You\u2019re the reason I\u2019m doing it.", "Bernadette: I said to stop insulting each other. I didn\u2019t tell you to take him on a romantic getaway.", "Howard: How do I know what you said? Damn you and your noise-cancelling breasts.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Bernadette: Hi.", "Howard: Hey, buddy.", "Bernadette: You excited for Texas?", "Sheldon: Oh, very much so.", "Howard: It\u2019s not every day you get to tour NASA with a real astronaut.", "Sheldon: Oh, who\u2019s the real astronaut?", "Howard: Buzz Aldrin.", "Sheldon: Oh. Yay.", "Scene: An airplane. ", "Sheldon: (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard? (Tap, tap, tap) Howard?", "Howard: What now?", "Sheldon: I have to go to the bathroom.", "Howard: You just went to the bathroom.", "Sheldon: But I didn\u2019t use it because it didn\u2019t seem safe. Despite all my e-mails, the toilet didn\u2019t have a seatbelt.", "Howard: Well, it still doesn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: I realize that, but safety concerns went out the window two apple juices ago.", "Howard: Fine.", "Sheldon: Why are you getting annoyed?", "Howard: I\u2019m trying to be a better friend, but you constantly say and do irritating things.", "Sheldon: Like when?", "Howard: When? How about in the car? I\u2019m an astronaut, and you know it. You just don\u2019t like admitting it, because you\u2019re jealous.", "Sheldon: Well, truth be told, as a child, I did dream of going to space. Those astronauts were my heroes. And when you got to go, it was hard for me.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Because it made me realize they\u2019ll just send anyone up there. Aren\u2019t you going to let me out?", "Howard: No.", "Sheldon: But I still need to use the bathroom.", "Howard: Here you go. Be creative. What\u2019s the matter? Scared of a little turbulence?", "Sheldon: No, turbulence is just the equalization of diurnal temperature variations in the atmosphere. I\u2019m not scared at all. Oh, apple juice, stay where you are.", "Howard: Oh, this is nothing. I experienced way worse when I was plummeting back to Earth, apparently not being a real astronaut. Okay, that was a big one.", "Sheldon: I take it back. I\u2019m scared of turbulence!", "Howard: I\u2019m gonna need that bag back.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: You sure you want to do this?", "Penny: Yeah. Why wouldn\u2019t I want to get my old job back? It\u2019ll be fun to see everyone. I haven\u2019t talked to them since I said I quit, see you at the Oscars, bitches. Come on, let\u2019s just get this over with.", "Leonard: Let\u2019s get this over with. Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory, or are we having sex? I\u2019m just, I\u2019m trying to lighten the mood.", "Penny: I know. Thank you.", "Leonard: Sorry.", "Penny: It\u2019s just so humiliating.", "Leonard: So humiliating? Am I driving you to the Cheesecake Factory\u2026? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll. I\u2019ll stop. I\u2019ll stop.", "Scene: Outside the building. ", "Leonard: Come on, don\u2019t look so sad. You never know what\u2019s gonna happen. Maybe tonight will be great.", "Penny: Sweetie, I know you\u2019re trying to make me feel better, and I love you for that, but it\u2019s making me feel worse, and I kind of hate you. This isn\u2019t your car.", "Leonard: I know. I thought we\u2019d take yours.", "Penny: I don\u2019t understand.", "Leonard: It\u2019s nothing fancy, but it\u2019ll get you to auditions, and at least for now, you don\u2019t have to go back to waitressing.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know what to say.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t say anything.", "Penny: Oh, my God.", "Leonard: I mean, you could say thank you. I did just buy you a car.", "Scene: A coffee shop.", "Amy: Look, I admit that it\u2019s odd that Rajesh didn\u2019t write to you himself, but if you get to know him, you\u2019ll see he\u2019s just a sweet, regular guy. As a counterpoint, here he is, uninvited and visibly sweaty.", "Raj: Hello, Emily.", "Emily: Hello.", "Raj: Amy told me you were concerned that I might be too passive and shy. Let me ask you something. Would a passive guy barge in here to look you in the eye and say, hey, dew-kissed flower, what\u2019s up?", "Emily: No, but a weird guy with no boundaries might.", "Raj: Uh, okay, that\u2019s a separate issue. Let\u2019s put a pin in that and just focus on the passive thing.", "Emily: I\u2019m leaving.", "Amy: Are we still going to go to that Chaucer reading Friday?", "Emily: You know, I think I\u2019m just gonna go by myself.", "Raj: Not my best first date. Yeah, but not my worst, either.", "Scene: The airplane.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry for every mean thing I ever did or said to you.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, too. It\u2019s all my fault.", "Sheldon: If you weren\u2019t my friend, there\u2019d be a hole in my life.", "Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Kind of like when Firefly was cancelled. But not as big.", "Announcement: The captain has turned off the fasten seat belt sign. You\u2019re now free to move about the cabin.", "Howard: It\u2019s over.", "Sheldon: Yeah.", "Howard: Should we stop holding hands now?", "Sheldon: In a minute.", "Howard: Okay, good."]}
