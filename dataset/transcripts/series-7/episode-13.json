We just have to sit there and take it.", "Leonard: You need to let it go, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: You work tirelessly for someone, and this is what you get.", "Leonard: Oh, my God, they\u2019re just making you use your vacation days.", "Sheldon: But I don\u2019t want a vacation.", "Leonard: Okay, listen, I don\u2019t mean to diminish what you\u2019re going through, but I\u2019m a little distracted right now.", "Sheldon: Oh, this again? So, Penny proposed, you didn\u2019t say yes, and now you think you may have lost her love forever. How does this compare to me being forced to relax for a few days?", "Leonard: It doesn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Leonard: I\u2019m gonna go talk to Penny. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019m going to go inside, put on my coziest pajamas, curl up with a good book and wait for this nightmare to be over. (Leonard knocks three times) Penny. Sorry.", "Penny: Hi.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Look, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t text you back. I just needed some time to think.", "Leonard: Okay.", "Penny: Yeah. Come in.", "Leonard: Look, if you want to break up, just say it.", "Penny: Leonard\u2026", "Leonard: No, no, no, no. I take it back. Don\u2019t say it. Just, just hate me, but stay with me. It worked for my parents.", "Penny: Listen, I don\u2019t want to break up with you.", "Leonard: Oh. Oh, okay. Good, good. So, it\u2019s cool if I cry a little?", "Penny: Yeah, I probably wouldn\u2019t.", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Penny: Look, you did the right thing last night. I was a mess. I was just frustrated because my career is going nowhere.", "Leonard: Look, I get it, and I want you to know that I support whatever you want to do.", "Penny: Great, because I\u2019ve been thinking, if I really want this acting thing to work, I need to focus all my energy on it. And to do that, I should quit waitressing at The Cheesecake Factory.", "Leonard: Wow. That, that\u2019s a big step.", "Penny: I know.", "Leonard: So, well, before making any rash\u2026", "Penny: I already quit.", "Leonard: And I support you.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Come on, take me to work with you.", "Leonard: No. You\u2019re on vacation.", "Sheldon: Please. What if there\u2019s a big breakthrough in science today and I\u2019m not there to see it?", "Leonard: Do you really think there\u2019s gonna be a breakthrough without you there to do it?", "Sheldon: No. I was just tricking you.", "Leonard: Bye.", "Sheldon: Leonard, wait. Take me with you.", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Please.", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Too bad. I\u2019m coming with you.", "Leonard: Oh, Sheldon, stay.", "Sheldon: But.", "Leonard: I said stay. I\u2019m going to work. Do not follow me. ", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Bernadette: Hey Stuart.", "Stuart: Hey.", "Bernadette: Sorry. Did I startle you?", "Stuart: Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does. What can I do for you?", "Bernadette: Well, I need a little help. I accidentally destroyed one of Howard\u2019s comic books this morning, and was hoping I could replace it.", "Stuart: Wow. What happened?", "Bernadette: Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.", "Stuart: Well, don\u2019t let The Riddler know that. It\u2019s a comic book joke. Or maybe it\u2019s not.", "Bernadette: Do you have this one?", "Stuart: Uh, well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty rare. Can you give me a few days to track it down?", "Bernadette: Ooh, I was kind of hoping to get it before Howie comes home from work.", "Stuart: Oh. What\u2019s the hurry?", "Bernadette: Well, he\u2019s always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron, and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.", "Stuart: Well, I\u2019ll do what I can, but I can\u2019t make any promises.", "Bernadette: You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company. If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication, antidepressants. ", "Stuart: Really? Do you have any of these?", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Amy: Hello, Mr. Rat Brain. Not so bitey without the rest of the rat to back us up now, are we?", "Howard: Anybody home?", "Amy: Hey, what brings you guys here?", "Raj: Well, we were just on our way to lunch and wanted to see if you\u2019d like to join.", "Amy: Why? Because Sheldon\u2019s not here this week, and you don\u2019t think I have any other options? I\u2019m just kidding. I\u2019ll get my purse.", "Bert: Hi, Amy. I, oh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know you had any company.", "Amy: That\u2019s okay. Uh, Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh. Guys, this is Bert.", "Howard: Hi.", "Raj: Hey. Good to see you.", "Bert: Anyway, I wanted to show you this tourmalinated quartzthat we got in the lab.", "Amy: This is so pretty. Bert works for the geology department.", "Bert: Yeah. You know what, uh, geologists and Bon Jovi have in common?", "Howard: You\u2019re both into rock?", "Bert: Yeah. Well, see ya.", "Amy: Oh, you forgot your quartz.", "Bert: Oh, it\u2019s okay. I want you to have it. Bye.", "Amy: He\u2019s nice.", "Howard: Yeah, he\u2019s nice because he likes you.", "Amy: What?! No, he doesn\u2019t.", "Raj: He brought you a pretty rock.", "Amy: So? He does that every day. Oh.", "Howard: You know, if you\u2019d rather skip lunch and hang out with your boyfriend Bert, it\u2019s totally okay.", "Amy: He\u2019s not my boyfriend.", "Raj: Are you sure? He\u2019s tall, pale and awkward. That sounds like your type.", "Amy: Should someone as lonely as you really be making fun of me?", "Raj: Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.", "Amy: What do I do? I don\u2019t want to hurt his feelings.", "Howard: Maybe the problem is he thinks you\u2019re available. Does he know you\u2019re dating Sheldon?", "Amy: I guess it hasn\u2019t come up.", "Howard: There you go. ", "Raj: And does Sheldon know you\u2019re dating Sheldon?", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry. Who are you dating?", "Raj: Yeah, knock it off, Howard.", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: Oh. Hey, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: You okay?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m on vacation. What do you think?", "Penny: Why are you sitting in the stairwell?", "Sheldon: Leonard told me to stay.", "Penny: Oh. Well, good boy.", "Sheldon: Where are you going?", "Penny: Oh, I have a ton of errands to run. I need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents and sign up for a new acting class.", "Sheldon: Well, have fun.", "Penny: Okay. You want to come with me?", "Sheldon: Really?", "Penny: Come on, boy. Come on. Let\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go. Get in the car. Come on.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Stuart (on phone): All right, thanks a lot. They have one at Capital Comics.", "Bernadette: Oh, that\u2019s great.", "Stuart: No, it\u2019s not. I hate that place. Guy who owns it is a jerk. He\u2019s always making me feel bad about myself.", "Bernadette: Oh, that\u2019s terrible. What\u2019s the address?", "Stuart: You know, why don\u2019t I just take you there? That way, I can make sure he doesn\u2019t rip you off.", "Bernadette: Oh, thanks, but I don\u2019twant you to close up. I mean, won\u2019t you lose business? Sorry. That was mean.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Amy: Penny really quit The Cheesecake Factory?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: So, what is she doing today?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. She already thinks I don\u2019t support this, so if I call, it might look like I\u2019m checking up on her.", "Raj: Well, do you support this?", "Leonard: Of course I do. She\u2019s a great actress. I\u2019m proud she\u2019s taking this risk.", "Amy: That\u2019s nice.", "Leonard: You bought that? Great. I got to call her before I forget how I said it. Hey.", "Penny: Hi. What\u2019s up?", "Leonard: Oh, how\u2019s it going? You taking Hollywood by storm?", "Penny: Actually, I\u2019m at The Cheesecake Factory.", "Leonard: You got your job back. That is great news. I didn\u2019t want to say anything, but you are making the right choice. To plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.", "Penny: Yeah. I\u2019m just returning my uniform.", "Leonard: And I support you.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Voice: Before we begin your guided meditation, close your eyes and picture yourself in a peaceful environment.", "Sheldon: Okay. I\u2019m inside the CERN super collider.", "Voice: Now, take a deep, relaxing breath in through your nose. And let it out.", "Sheldon: Wow. Didn\u2019t see that coming.", "Voice: In. ", "Sheldon: Let me guess.", "Voice: And out.", "Sheldon: What was I gonna do? Two ins in a row? Where\u2019s my lemonade?", "Penny: I didn\u2019t get it.", "Sheldon: A fitting swan song to your career as a waitress, to forget my order one last time.", "Penny: Do you think quitting my job was a mistake?", "Sheldon: Do you see me drinking lemonade?", "Penny: No. I\u2019m serious.", "Sheldon: Why do you ask?", "Penny: Because Leonard just pissed me off. Am I being an idiot or not?", "Sheldon: No, I don\u2019t think you are. ", "Penny: Really?", "Sheldon: The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it. When I decided I was going to be a physicist, I didn\u2019t take some other job in case it didn\u2019t work out. Which wasn\u2019t easy because there was a lot of pressure from Ms. Pearson for me to be chalk monitor that year.", "Penny: Thank you. I needed to hear that. Why can\u2019t Leonard understand it?", "Sheldon: Because he\u2019s not like us, Penny. We\u2019re dreamers.", "Penny: Yeah, I need to start cracking the window when I leave you in the car.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Bert: Hey.", "Amy: Hello, Bert.", "Bert: So, anyway, there\u2019s this big, uh, rock and mineral show next week in Santa Monica.", "Amy: Listen, um, Bert, before you say anything else, I, I have a boyfriend.", "Bert: Oh. This is awkward. You thought I was gonna ask you to go with me to the mineral show.", "Amy: Weren\u2019t you?", "Bert: Yeah.", "Amy: That\u2019s very nice of you, but I do have a boyfriend.", "Bert: That\u2019s what you all say. You just don\u2019t want to go out with me because I have an off-putting personality.", "Amy: No, that\u2019s not true. My boyfriend has an off-putting personality, too. Like, way worse than you.", "Bert: Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m used to it. I mean, I\u2019m big and weird and funny-looking and no one ever wants to do anything with me.", "Amy: Don\u2019t say that. ", "Bert: It\u2019s okay. I know I\u2019m a monster. ", "Amy: No, Bert, come on. I\u2019d love to go to the mineral show with you.", "Bert: Sweet. It\u2019s a date.", "Amy: No, it\u2019s not.", "Bert: Too late.", "Scene: Capital Comics.", "Bernadette: Wow.", "Stuart: Yeah. Haven\u2019t seen this many people in my store since that Korean church bus crashed through my front window.", "Jesse: Hey, Stuart.", "Stuart: Jesse.", "Jesse: Haven\u2019t seen you in forever. Look how grey you\u2019ve gotten.", "Stuart: My hair\u2019s exactly the same colour as always.", "Jesse: No, I was talking about your skin.", "Stuart: Look, uh, my friend here needs a comic book.", "Jesse: Ooh, and she went into your store by mistake. Good thing there was no one there to see you. What do you need? Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this. Right over here.", "Stuart: Even you, Sweatpants?", "Sweatpants: Free popcorn.", "Jesse: Can I offer you a coffee? Espresso? Latte?", "Bernadette: No, thanks.", "Jesse: How about you, Stu? Mocha? Scone? Directions to the nearest soup kitchen?", "Bernadette: Hey.", "Jesse: I\u2019m just kidding. He knows where the soup kitchen is.", "Stuart: It\u2019s on Merton Avenue.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t think I like the way you\u2019re treating my friend.", "Jesse: Sorry. You want the book or not?", "Bernadette: Not from you. Let\u2019s go, Stuart.", "Stuart: You know something, Jesse? You may have a successful business and the kind of pink complexion that comes with good nutrition, but I have something more important.", "Jesse: What\u2019s that?", "Stuart: Friendship. Which I would trade in a heartbeat for all of this.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s laboratory.", "Howard: The mineral and rock show? That would be awful even without Bert.", "Amy: So what am I supposed to do now?", "Raj: Prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring?", "Amy: This isn\u2019t funny. I\u2019m gonna have to tell him the truth, that even if I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, I wouldn\u2019t be interested in him.", "Howard: Oh, I\u2019ve heard those words so many times. From Linda Nosenchuck, Tammy Rosenworcel.", "Raj: Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury.", "Howard: Marci Grossman, Lisa Mazzarino.", "Raj: Megan Pincus.", "Howard: Tammy Cho.", "Raj: Oh, who was that girl from our Starbucks?", "Howard: Arlene Russel.", "Raj: Yes. Arlene. She wrote no way on both our cappuccinos.", "Howard: Poor Bert. That guy\u2019s got a rough afternoon ahead of him.", "Amy: Well, how would you want a girl to tell you she wasn\u2019t interested?", "Raj: I guess, uh, I\u2019d like her to sit me down, look me in the eye and say, I was wrong. I love you. And then maybe she could touch me in a special way.", "Howard: That\u2019s how you reject a guy.", "Amy: Okay, I don\u2019t have time for this. I\u2019m just gonna go find him and be brutally honest.", "Howard: No, don\u2019t.", "Raj: He\u2019ll be so upset. He\u2019ll probably climb up the Empire State Building and start swatting at planes.", "Howard: You want us to talk to him?", "Amy: Really? You would do that?", "Raj: Sure. We\u2019ve both been in his shoes. We\u2019ll let him down with compassion and respect.", "Amy: Thank you.", "Howard: Let\u2019s go.", "Raj: So we tell him she\u2019s a lesbian, right?", "Howard: Of course we tell him she\u2019s a lesbian.", "Scene: The apartment. Penny and Sheldon are doing yoga.", "Penny: And hold three, two, one. Very good. Now let\u2019s try Warrior 2. And hold.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve read that there are great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies they can draw water in through their genitals.", "Penny: Yeah, well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re gonna get to do that today.", "Sheldon: Too bad. It seems like a good way to drink a milk shake without getting brain freeze.", "Leonard: Oh, hey.", "Penny: And now we go to Reverse Warrior.", "Leonard: How did she get you to do yoga?", "Sheldon: Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.", "Penny: I\u2019m helping him relax because, unlike you, he supports me.", "Leonard: Oh, how many times do I have to say it? I support you.", "Penny: Sheldon, take a break.", "Sheldon: Namaste.", "Penny: Okay, if you support me, what was with that phone call?", "Leonard: Fine. I\u2019m not sure you should have quit. But if you care so much what I think, why didn\u2019t you ask me before you did it?", "Penny: Oh, so now I need your permission? Would you have asked me before you quit your job?", "Leonard: Yes. I thought we were in the kind of relationship where we make decisions together. If I\u2019m wrong, then maybe we need to talk about the kind of relationship we\u2019re actually in.", "Penny: Yeah, well, maybe we do.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m willing to if you guys are.", "Leonard: Can we please have some privacy?", "Sheldon: Y, No. I\u2019m as much a part of this relationship as you two, and I think it\u2019s high time we put all our cards on the table. For example, where is this going? Are you two ever getting married? And, if so, where will we all live? Have you thought about that?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Penny?", "Penny: Okay, wait. What are we doing?", "Leonard: For some reason, we\u2019re planning a future where we both live with Sheldon forever.", "Sheldon: Good. Now we\u2019re getting somewhere.", "Penny: Look, I know you think I\u2019m being reckless, and you might be right, but I need to take this shot.", "Sheldon: Yeah, no kidding. Despite what it says on her r\u00e9sum\u00e9, she is no longer 22. ", "Leonard: I swear, I am on your side. ", "Penny: You keep saying you\u2019re on my side, but you don\u2019t act like it.", "Sheldon: He does that to me, too. Why do we put up with it?", "Leonard: Listen, I could never do what you\u2019re doing, okay? I would be terrified.", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s scary for me, too.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m fine with it.", "Leonard: My point is, just because I couldn\u2019t do it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t. And I\u2019m proud of you. ", "Penny: Okay. Thank you.", "Sheldon: Well, to celebrate this reconciliation, let\u2019s all share a milk shake. Uh, Penny, you\u2019ll need a straw.", "Scene: Capital Comics.", "Jesse: You\u2019re back.", "Bernadette: Yes, I am, there\u2019s a few more things I want to say to you. Stuart\u2019s store is just fine, and he\u2019s a much nicer person than you are, and if you still have that comic, I\u2019d like to buy it right now.", "Jesse: No problem. Oh, you want a latte while you wait?", "Bernadette: No, I don\u2019t want a latte. I want a cappuccino and a blueberry scone. ", "Jesse: I only have chocolate chip.", "Bernadette: Well, that sounds even better.", "Scene: Bert\u2019s car.", "Bert: Thanks for coming to the mineral and rock show with me.", "Raj: We\u2019re sorry Amy didn\u2019t want to go.", "Howard: Really, really sorry.", "Bert: Eh. Who needs her when I have you guys? Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock show! Rock sho-o-o-o-o-ow!"]}
