You\u2019re doing great.", "Howard: Thanks for lifting my spirits. Next time, try lifting the box.", "Raj: Please hurry.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I don\u2019t need a treadmill.", "Howard: The doctor says you need to get exercise.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I get plenty of exercise.", "Howard: Crushing my will to live isn\u2019t exercise.", "Raj: If she isn\u2019t gonna use it, then why are we doing this?", "Howard: She\u2019ll use it. All I need is to rig it with a fishing pole and a HoneyBaked Ham.", "Raj: All right. Now what?", "Bernadette: We set it up in Howie\u2019s old room.", "Raj: Do you know how to set it up?", "Howard: Please, I\u2019m an MIT-trained engineer. I think I can handle\u2026 Ma, look out.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Aaaaah! I told you this thing would kill me.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: So she\u2019s gonna be laid up for at least six weeks.", "Leonard: Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.", "Amy: Should we do something for her?", "Sheldon: I know. Let\u2019s go see the new Spider-Man movie.", "Amy: Sheldon, we\u2019re talking about your friend\u2019s mother. She got hurt.", "Sheldon: I thought that subject had run its course, so I changed it. It\u2019s called reading the room, Amy.", "Penny: Hi.", "Leonard: Hey, how were things on the set?", "Penny: Uh, pretty good, actually.", "Raj: So the movie\u2019s not as bad as you thought?", "Penny: Oh, no, it is, but I decided instead of complaining about it, I\u2019m just gonna go in every day and give it my all.", "Amy: Good for you.", "Penny: Thanks. There\u2019s no reason why I shouldn\u2019t be the best bisexual go-go dancer slowly transforming into a killer gorilla anyone\u2019s ever seen.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. The bisexual gorilla go-go dancer in Schindler\u2019s List is tough to beat.", "Sheldon: Ah, very good. Because a gorilla go-go dancer of any sexual preference would be out of place in a film about the Holocaust.", "Leonard: It only gets funnier when you explain it, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I know.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Howard: Okay, she\u2019s all settled in the guest room.", "Bernadette: Maybe we should get one of those machines to help her up the stairs.", "Howard: You mean a forklift?", "Bernadette: Howie.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry. I just can\u2019t deal with this right now.", "Bernadette: Taking care of your own mother? How can you say that?", "Howard: Bernie, she\u2019s gonna be off her feet for six to eight weeks. Are you prepared to feed her, wash her and take her to the toilet?", "Bernadette: I would do it for my mother.", "Howard: Yeah, of course you would, you\u2019re a loving person. I\u2019m what my people would call a putz.", "Bernadette: Look, I\u2019m not crazy about the idea, but what other choice do we have?", "Howard: We get a nurse. Preferably someone from a third world country who\u2019s used to suffering and unpleasant smells.", "Bernadette: You\u2019d hire a total stranger to take care of the woman who raised you? That\u2019s so cruel.", "Howard: Not if we pay them well and let them listen to the music of their homeland.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I need to tinkle.", "Howard: Sounds like a job for a loving person. Would you like me to play some Polish music while you carry her to the toilet?", "Bernadette: You are a putz.", "Howard: As advertised.", "Scene: A cinema.", "Sheldon: Thanks for coming with me.", "Raj: Thanks for inviting me after everyone else said no. Aren\u2019t you gonna get 3-D glasses?", "Sheldon: I brought my own. No sense in risking bridge-of-nose herpes.", "Raj: Is that a real thing?", "Sheldon: Well, until they invent nose condoms, I\u2019m not finding out.", "Raj: Emily, Hey.", "Emily: Oh, hey, Raj.", "Raj: Uh, this is my friend, Sheldon. Sheldon, this is Emily.", "Sheldon: Oh, yes, you\u2019re the dermatologist. I went for a walk yesterday without sunscreen. Do you see anything on my forehead that I should be concerned about?", "Emily: Um, you know what? I better go. My movie\u2019s about to start.", "Raj: Are you here alone?", "Emily: No, not really.", "Raj: What do you mean, not really?", "Man: Hey, should we get our seats?", "Emily: Yeah. It was nice seeing you. Um, I\u2019ll call you later.", "Raj: Yeah, okay.", "Sheldon: That was awkward, right?", "Raj: Uh-huh.", "Sheldon: Is it because she\u2019s dating you but was out with that other fellow?", "Raj: Yes.", "Sheldon: Good. I thought she saw something on my forehead.", "Scene: The movie set. ", "Director: And action.", "Wil Wheaton: Please don\u2019t shut me out.", "Penny: Go away. Just go away.", "Wil: I swear, I will find a way to turn you back.", "Penny: What gave you the right to mix my DNA with that of a killer gorilla?", "Wil: I was trying to save your life.", "Penny: Life? What life? Look at me, I\u2019m a monster. And now I have blood on my hands, or paws. I don\u2019t know.", "Wil: You can\u2019t give up. I love you.", "Penny: I love you, too. But I\u2019m afraid I love killing more. Like, one day, I might actually try and kill you.", "Director: And cut. All right. All right, let\u2019s set up for the next scene.", "Penny: Actually, you know what? Can we do one more? I think I could do it better.", "Director: Let\u2019s just move on. No one cares.", "Penny: Well, I care. I mean, look, if we\u2019re gonna do this, why not try and make it something we\u2019re actually proud of?", "Director: Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage, but you should be happy about that, \u2019cause if it was a good movie, you wouldn\u2019t be in it.", "Leonard: Whoa, whoa, hang on. There\u2019s no need to insult her.", "Director: And who are you?", "Leonard: I\u2019m her boyfriend.", "Director: Isn\u2019t she too hot for you?", "Leonard: A little, yeah.", "Director: Well, boyfriend, get off my set.", "Penny: You can\u2019t do that. He\u2019s with me.", "Director: You know what? You can get off my set, too. You\u2019re fired.", "Penny: What? You can\u2019t fire me. I\u2019m the star. I\u2019m the girl that goes bananas. It says so on the poster.", "Director: Yeah, but we just shot the last scene where we see your face. So from now own, the star of the movie is whoever wears this.", "Wil: Hey, if you\u2019re gonna fire her, then you have to fire me, too.", "Scene: A bar.", "Wil: Wow, that fell apart really fast.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Thanks for skipping the movie. I couldn\u2019t sit in that theatre for two hours wondering about Emily and that guy.", "Sheldon: Oh, quite all right. After my forehead melanoma scare I\u2019ve learned not to sweat the small stuff. Well, sorry, I don\u2019t have all the ingredients to make chai tea.", "Raj: You don\u2019t have to make me anything.", "Sheldon: No, I do. You\u2019re upset about Emily and you\u2019re Indian. I need to make you chai tea. Now, I have all the ingredients except cardamom seeds. Do you happen to have any on you?", "Raj: Sorry, I left them in my turban.", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019ll make English breakfast tea. They destroyed your culture. That\u2019s close enough. You know, I\u2019m curious, why are you so upset about seeing Emily with another man?", "Raj: Wouldn\u2019t you be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else?", "Sheldon: Can\u2019t happen. We have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me.", "Raj: But you don\u2019t have sex with her, either.", "Sheldon: Slick, huh?", "Raj: To be truthful, Emily and I haven\u2019t dated that long, and we never agreed to be exclusive to each other.", "Sheldon: Have you had intercourse?", "Raj: No.", "Sheldon: Well, stick to your guns. There will be a lot of pressure.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m hungry again.", "Howard: It\u2019s like the world\u2019s fattest cuckoo clock.", "Bernadette: You know, you\u2019re always talking about having a baby someday. This is exactly what it\u2019s gonna be like.", "Howard: No, it\u2019s not.", "Bernadette: Come on. The constant fussing, eating, pooping, burping, drooling. We\u2019re even waiting for the day when she can finally walk on her own.", "Howard: Maybe you\u2019re right. Anything she finds on the floor goes right in her mouth.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m just telling you now, if we do have kids, don\u2019t expect me to do all the work.", "Howard: Hey, I\u2019m a very paternal person. I\u2019d be excellent at taking care of a baby.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): I\u2019m still hungry.", "Howard: I\u2019m coming, you big baby.", "Scene: The bar.", "Penny: You know, the only thing worse than doing a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass is getting fired from a movie where they glue monkey hair to your ass.", "Wil: Forget it, man, it\u2019s crap. You just move on to the next thing.", "Penny: Yeah, well, it\u2019s easy for you to say. You used to be famous.", "Wil: Hey. I just lost a job for you.", "Penny: All right, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re famous.", "Wil: Penny, it\u2019s not about being famous. It\u2019s about the art. It\u2019s about the passion we have for our craft. (Text message tone) I have an audition for Sharknado 2. If I book this, I am totally gonna pay you back for this beer.", "Penny: God, what am I doing with my life?", "Leonard: You having second thoughts about acting?", "Penny: You were on set, you saw what it was like.", "Leonard: Yeah, but it\u2019s not always that bad.", "Penny: Oh, really?", "Leonard: What about when you did, uh, Anne Frank at that cute little theater?", "Penny: It was over a bowling alley.", "Leonard: Yeah, but there was ample parking.", "Penny: Are you done?", "Leonard: And you were so good in the TV commercial.", "Penny: It was for haemorrhoid cream.", "Leonard: And I got itchy and swollen just watching you.", "Penny: Leonard, you are really not cheering me up.", "Leonard: Come on. How can you be sad when you\u2019re going home with all five-foot-six of this?", "Penny: Hmm. You think you\u2019re five-foot-six, that\u2019s funny.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: I don\u2019t understand it. I\u2019m a nice guy, I have a great job, I\u2019m well-educated, come from a good family. Why don\u2019t women want to be with me?", "Sheldon: An interesting question. Well, good night.", "Raj: What? Don\u2019t send me home. I can\u2019t be alone right now.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s your problem. You can\u2019t be alone.", "Raj: What do you mean?", "Sheldon: How many women have you had dates with?", "Raj: Eleven.", "Sheldon: How many of those women did you think would become your perfect companion?", "Raj: Eleven. Wait. Do I count the 200-pound Sailor Moon girl that Howard and I had a threesome with at Comic Con?", "Sheldon: Sure.", "Raj: I\u2019ll stick with eleven. She liked Howard better.", "Sheldon: Well, now do you see the problem?", "Raj: Maybe. I, I don\u2019t know.It\u2019s late, I should, I should go. Look, I do get what you\u2019re saying. Instead of desperately clinging to any woman who will go out with me, I need to work on my fear of being alone.", "Sheldon: I was trying to suggest chemical castration, but it\u2019s my bedtime, so whatever gets you out the door. Good night.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Bernadette: Howie, I\u2019m back!", "Howard: Shh, I just got her to sleep.", "Bernadette: Sorry.", "Howard: What took you so long? The grocery store is a few blocks away.", "Bernadette: They only had regular yoghurt. I had to go to a different store to get the extra-fat kind your mom likes.", "Howard: Then why do I smell coffee on your breath?", "Bernadette: So what? After two days of taking care of her, excuse me for stopping to get a mocha.", "Howard: A mocha? Well, it must be nice to be queen.", "Bernadette: Queen? I\u2019ve been killing myself here.", "Howard: Well, whose fault is that? I wanted to get a nurse, but you were all, I\u2019m nice, I want to take care of people.", "Bernadette: I\u2019m glad I got that mocha. And you know what else I\u2019m glad about? I bought you a brownie and I ate it in the car.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Howard.", "Howard: Thanks a lot. Now I have to go rub her belly again.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: Hey.", "Emily: Thanks for letting me come over.", "Raj: Of course. Please, come in.", "Emily: I just wanted to say how sorry I am about tonight, and I want to make sure that we\u2019re okay.", "Raj: Uh, look, you and I haven\u2019t made any commitments to each other.", "Emily: I know. I just felt like I needed to explain. The guy I was with did my last tattoo, and he\u2019s been asking me out for months. I finally said yes just to get it over with.", "Raj: It\u2019s okay.", "Emily: Really?", "Raj: Well, I mean, yeah, it freaked me out a little, but that\u2019s my issue, not yours.", "Emily: Wow. If I saw you out with another woman, I\u2019d be pretty upset.", "Raj: Thank you. Not just for being upset, but for believing that could happen.", "Emily: Just so you know, I\u2019m not seeing anyone else.", "Raj: Well, me, neither.", "Emily: Okay.", "Raj: Okay. Please. So, uh, you, you have tattoos?", "Emily: Yeah.", "Raj: I don\u2019t. I have a hole in my belly button that may or may not have been a piercing.", "Emily: That\u2019s cool.", "Raj: It\u2019s a piercing. So, uh, how many tattoos?", "Emily: One on my shoulder, one not on my shoulder and one really not on my shoulder.", "Raj: It\u2019s, uh, been a long time since I\u2019ve seen a girl\u2019s really not her shoulder.", "Emily: Well, how about you show me your piercing and I show you my tattoos?", "Raj: But, uh, before I take my shirt off, I just need like ten minutes to do some crunches.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Oh, my God. What a day.", "Leonard: Can I get you anything?", "Penny: No. I need to start making some smart decisions.", "Leonard: With your career?", "Penny: With my life.", "Leonard: Like what?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. We could get married.", "Leonard: Come on, be serious.", "Penny: I am.", "Leonard: Why? Because I\u2019m a, a smart decision?", "Penny: Well, yeah.", "Leonard: So I\u2019m like a bran muffin.", "Penny: What? No, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m the boring thing you\u2019re choosing because I\u2019m good for you.", "Penny: What does it matter? The point is, I\u2019m choosing you.", "Leonard: Well, it matters a lot. I don\u2019t want to be a bran muffin. I, I want to be a Cinnabon, you know? A strawberry Pop-Tart. Something you\u2019re excited about even though it could give you diabetes.", "Penny: Sweetie, you can be any pastry you want.", "Leonard: No, no. No, it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m your bran muffin. Probably fat-free and good for your colon.", "Penny: You know what? Forget it. I never should\u2019ve brought it up.", "Leonard: You know I want to marry you, but you\u2019re only doing this because you got fired and you\u2019re feeling sorry for yourself.", "Penny: Okay, it may look that way, but getting fired from that movie was the best thing that could have happened to me, okay? I finally realize I don\u2019t need to be famous or have some big career to be happy.", "Leonard: Then what do you need?", "Penny: You, you stupid Pop-Tart.", "Leonard: Oh. Then I guess I\u2019m in.", "Penny: Really? You guess you\u2019re in?", "Leonard: Not like, I guess I\u2019m in. Like I guess, I\u2019m in!", "Penny: Okay. Leonard: Cool.", "Leonard: So is that it? Are, are we engaged?", "Penny: Yeah, I think so.", "Leonard: All right.", "Penny: What\u2019s wrong?", "Leonard: I\u2019m not sure. Just feels a little anticlimactic.", "Penny: Yeah, it kind of does, huh?", "Leonard: Oh, I know. This might help.", "Penny: Where did you get a ring?", "Leonard: I\u2019ve had it for a couple years, not important. Penny, will you marry me?", "Penny: Oh, my God, yes.", "Leonard: This would have been so much more romantic if you didn\u2019t have monkey hair on your finger.", "Scene: Mrs Wolowitz\u2019s house.", "Howard: How you feeling?", "Bernadette: Last night was a little rough, but I think we\u2019re gonna get through this.", "Howard: I\u2019m proud of us.", "Bernadette: Me, too.", "Mrs Wolowitz (off): Where\u2019s my pancakes?!", "Foreign Nurse: Coming, Mrs. Wolowitz!", "Bernadette: You were right.", "Howard: Welcome to Team Putz."]}
