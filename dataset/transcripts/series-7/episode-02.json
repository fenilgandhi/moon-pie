Great.", "Sheldon: Changes in jet streams can affect the speed at which the Earth rotates on its axis, so bad weather can actually make the day longer.", "Penny: Well, there must be a hell of a storm somewhere.", "Sheldon: Joke if you must, but you\u2019re going to miss these moments. With Leonard home in a few days, this was your last time driving me to the grocery store.", "Penny: You know, I will miss this.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll tell you what, if my apples are mealy, we\u2019ll hit the produce section for one last crazy blowout. Heck, you can even push the cart. Please don\u2019t take my looking forward to Leonard\u2019s return as criticism of the job you\u2019ve been doing in his absence.", "Penny: I won\u2019t.", "Sheldon: That criticism will come later in your report card.", "Penny: Yeah, I didn\u2019t stay for the detention, I\u2019m not gonna read the report card.", "Leonard (in Penny\u2019s apartment): Hello.", "Penny (screams): Leonard! Hi!", "Leonard: Keep your voice down.", "Penny: Oh, my God. You weren\u2019t supposed to be here till Sunday.", "Leonard: We finished the experiment early, so I thought I\u2019d come home and surprise you.", "Penny: Oh, my gosh, why are we whispering?", "Leonard: I didn\u2019t tell Sheldon, so we could have a few days alone.", "Penny: Oh, that is so romantic.", "Leonard: Uh, sure, that\u2019s why I did it.", "Penny: Oh, I just cannot believe you\u2019re here.", "Sheldon (off): Penny, it\u2019s your lucky day. Three of the eggs are clearly not jumbo. Grab your keys.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Sheldon: Uh, Stuart, I was wondering if you could help me find something.", "Stuart: Happy to, unless it\u2019s hope or a reason to live.", "Sheldon: Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown. Anyhoo, Leonard will be back in a couple days and I need a welcome home gift for him. As he\u2019s been at sea, perhaps something with a nautical theme might be appropriate.", "Stuart: Okay, well, I don\u2019t know how much you want to spend, but I do have this pretty cool Aquaman statue.", "Sheldon: Aquaman? Oh, this isn\u2019t a gag gift, Stuart.", "Stuart: Yeah, just as well. It\u2019s a pretty rare piece. I\u2019d rather just sell it to a real collector.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m a real collector. How rare is it?", "Stuart: Oh, I shouldn\u2019t even have mentioned it. How about a Batman squirt gun?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t try and trick me into buying something I don\u2019t want. Now let\u2019s talk Aquaman. ", "Howard: What were they thinking, putting Doctor Octopus\u2019s mind in Spider-Man\u2019s body?", "Raj: Well, I\u2019ve been quite enjoying that. It combines all the superhero fun of Spider-Man with all the body-switching shenanigans of Freaky Friday. Both versions, original and Lohan.", "Howard: Both versions: original and Lohan. You\u2019re an idiot.", "Raj: Hey, what\u2019s your problem?", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve been kind of snippy lately. It\u2019s probably this stupid diet I\u2019m on.", "Raj: Why are you on a diet?", "Howard: I\u2019ve put on a couple pounds. Had to buy these pants in the men\u2019s section.", "Raj: Well, we\u2019ve all seen your mom. That Butterball turkey was bound to come home to roost.", "Sheldon: Twelve hundred dollars. That\u2019s my final offer.", "Stuart: All right, Sheldon, you win. I\u2019m sure Leonard is gonna love this.", "Sheldon: Oh, right, a present for Leonard. You better throw in that squirt gun.", "Stuart: Ooh, yeah, I don\u2019t know. This squirt gun, it\u2019s, uh, it\u2019s pretty rare.", "Sheldon: Oh.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: And this is me doing the Titanic pose on the boat.", "Penny: Ah.", "Leonard: And, oh, that\u2019s me getting rescued after I fell in.", "Penny: Oh. (Knock on door) Oh, that\u2019s the pizza.", "Leonard: Yep. Here\u2019s some money.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Leonard: And I\u2019m gonna hit the head. That\u2019s what us salty sea dogs say when we have to go pee-pee.", "Penny: Hey.", "Pizza guy: Twenty-two fifty.", "Penny: Okay, here\u2019s, uh, twenty-five. Keep the change.", "Pizza guy: Seriously? I just walked up, like, four flights of stairs.", "Penny: Oh. Okay. Well, here\u2019s, um, thirty something cents and a promise I won\u2019t call your boss and tell him you reek of marijuana.", "Sheldon: Oh, Penny, I see you\u2019ve ordered pizza. I have Chinese food. ", "Penny: That\u2019s nice.", "Sheldon: Oh, that\u2019s a rather earthy cologne. My uncle used to wear that. Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal together before Leonard returns.", "Penny: Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel like eating alone tonight, so\u2026", "Sheldon: Are you sure? With your Italian pizza and my Chinese noodles, we could play Marco Polo. I mean, of course, a re-enactment of a meal in the life of Marco Polo the Venetian explorer, not Marco Polo the terrifying water sport.", "Penny: Uh, yeah, it sounds fun, but no thanks. (Toilet flushes) Have a good night!", "Sheldon: What, now, do you have company?", "Penny: No. No, no, no. You know what? The toilet\u2019s been doing that. I called the building manager, so\u2026", "Sheldon: Oh, I can take a look at it.", "Penny: Well\u2026", "Sheldon: I\u2019m quite familiar with plumbing. Not to brag, but I spent most of fifth grade with my head in a toilet.", "Penny: Yeah, no, no, no. You know what, Sheldon, it\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to go into the bathroom.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s curious. If there\u2019s no one here, why are there two glasses of wine on the table?", "Penny: Oh. Well, you know, I, I\u2019ve got two hands and a bit of a drinking problem.", "Sheldon: Of course. Ask a silly question. ", "Penny: Oh. ", "Sheldon: That\u2019s odd.", "Penny: Um, what?", "Sheldon: There are takeout containers in the trash can.", "Penny: So? That\u2019s my dinner from last night.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s odd is they\u2019re in the trash can.", "Penny: Okay. Look, honey, I promise there\u2019s no one\u2019s here. I\u2018ve had a long day. I just want to have a quiet dinner by myself.", "Sheldon: Oh, very well. I\u2019m no stranger to enjoying the pleasures of solitude. Oh!", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Have you gotten Leonard a welcome-home gift yet?", "Penny: No.", "Sheldon: Oh, great. Do you want to go halfsies on a two hundred dollar squirt gun?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Hi, honey.", "Howard: Hey.", "Bernadette: I made some brownies. You want one?", "Howard: You\u2019re kidding, right? I mean, you know I\u2019m trying to lose weight. God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.", "Bernadette: We are. Stop it. And for the last time, you\u2019re not fat.", "Howard: Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale, \u2019cause one of you is lying.", "Bernadette: Fine, forget I asked. How was dinner at your mom\u2019s?", "Howard: Awful. I had to rub her ointment all over her again.", "Bernadette: Why can\u2019t she do it?", "Howard: \u2018Cause we\u2019ve got a deeply unhealthy relationship. Which reminds me, do you think you can get any samples of this from work? This was supposed to last her a month, but they didn\u2019t take into account the square footage of her back.", "Bernadette: Let me see. How long have you been putting this on her?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Few weeks. Why?", "Bernadette: This is really strong oestrogen cream. Please tell me you\u2019ve been wearing gloves.", "Howard: Like these swollen sausages could fit in gloves.", "Bernadette: Howie, the oestrogen\u2019s getting absorbed by your skin. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been all bloated and moody and a giant pain in the ass. ", "Howard: You\u2019re full of oestrogen and you don\u2019t act like that.", "Bernadette: That\u2019s \u2019cause I\u2019m a woman. I\u2019ve had years of practice riding the dragon.", "Howard: Fine. I\u2019ll wear gloves next time.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s still gonna take a few weeks for the hormones to leave your system.", "Howard: I feel so stupid. And fat.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s okay. You still look great to me. In fact, why don\u2019t we go in the bedroom and I\u2019ll prove it to you?", "Howard: Sex? Really? I mean, that\u2019s just your solution to everything. ", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Oh, and here\u2019s a fun thing. I worked it out so that there are two different words for spoon, planko and janko. Planko is a spoon with food, janko is a spoon without food. Janko is spelled with a silent ptang. Sheldon, you\u2019re not even listening to the rules of my made-up language.", "Sheldon: Yes, I am.", "Amy: Then what does tweepadock mean?", "Sheldon: Uh, elephant?", "Amy: Lucky guess.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just distracted by something that happened over at Penny\u2019s.", "Amy: What happened?", "Sheldon: I fear Penny is being unfaithful to Leonard.", "Amy: What?", "Sheldon: She claimed to be alone when there was obviously someone else in her apartment. I have no choice but to assume the worst, given Leonard\u2019s lengthy sea voyage and her famously ravenous nether regions.", "Amy: I don\u2019t think Penny would cheat on Leonard.", "Sheldon: Oh, really? She and I once had a staring contest. She clapped really loud and made me blink. It\u2019s a small leap from there to sexual infidelity.", "Amy: You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "Sheldon: Amy, there were Chinese food containers in the trash can.", "Amy: Poor Leonard.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy listening at Penny\u2019s door.", "Amy: Do you hear anything?", "Sheldon: I hear a woman\u2019s voice.", "Amy: Is it Penny?", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s you. All right, I hear whispering and giggling. Now I think I hear kissing.", "Amy: Yeah, like you know what kissing sounds like.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s kissing in Star Trek, smarty-pants.", "Amy: Let me listen. Sounds like Leonard.", "Sheldon: Please. Why would Leonard come home early and waste his time kissing Penny when he could be hanging out with his best buddy? Yeah, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m catching her in the act. (Unlocks door)", "Amy: No, Sheldon, don\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Aha. ", "Penny: What the hell?", "Sheldon: Leonard?", "Penny: Sheldon, you cannot just barge in here like that. ", "Sheldon: Right. (Goes out.) (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. Are you going to answer the door or should I open it and say aha again?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon. I should\u2019ve told you I was back. I just wanted to have a couple days alone with Penny.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, I should apologize. Uh, I never realized to what extent our friendship was a burden to you.", "Leonard: That is not fair. I complain about what a burden it is at least once a month.", "Sheldon: Oh, no, no, let\u2019s not sugarcoat this. You find me finicky, pedantic and annoying.", "Penny: No, he doesn\u2019t.", "Leonard: I actually have used those exact words before. In that order.", "Sheldon: Well, Leonard, I think it\u2019s high time you and I address the tweepadock in the room.", "Leonard: The what?", "Sheldon: Amy?", "Amy: Please leave me out of this.", "Sheldon: Fine. Leonard, there\u2019s no need for you to pretend to like me anymore.", "Leonard: Come on, I said I was sorry.", "Sheldon: No, no, you save your apologies for after you\u2019ve had disappointing coitus with Penny.", "Penny: It was fine.", "Leonard: Come on, this is silly. Hey, um, I brought you back a little present from my trip, huh? It\u2019s that sailor cap that you wanted. It\u2019s neat, huh?", "Sheldon: You honestly think you can buy back my friendship with a cheap souvenir?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t. Just try it on. Oh, yeah.", "Amy: Hello, sailor.", "Penny: Ooh, now we\u2019re talking.", "Sheldon: Excuse me. This changes nothing. Except the Halloween costume I\u2019m wearing this year. Amy, you\u2019re going to be Olive Oyl. Lay off the doughnuts.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: Thanks for coming over.", "Raj: No problem. Ooh, you made little sandwiches.", "Howard: Yeah, that\u2019s cucumber and cream cheese. That\u2019s turkey and loganberry. And don\u2019t tell my hips, but I\u2019m warming up a brie in the oven.", "Raj: Nice. So, mmm. What\u2019s up?", "Howard: Okay, well, I\u2019ve been reading up on all the side effects you can get from oestrogen, and, I need you to be honest with me. Do my boobs look bigger to you?", "Raj: Well, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell. ", "Howard: Come on, Raj, it\u2019s a yes or no question.", "Raj: I\u2019m not sure. Um, wait. Jump up and down, let\u2019s see if they jiggle. Uh, no, I, I still can\u2019t tell, uh, oh, you know what? Okay, uh, give me some of this.", "Howard: Seriously?", "Raj: Do you want my help or not?", "Howard: Fine.", "Raj: Okay, yup. See, see, that, that looks like, that looks like they could be bigger. But you know, I bet, I bet when I do it, mine do the same thing.", "Howard: Yeah, they kind of do.", "Raj: Hmm. Uh, let me see something. (Grabs his boob)", "Howard: Hey, easy, my nipples are sensitive.", "Raj: Oh. Sorry, sorry, uh, okay. (Grabs boob again. Behind them, Bernadette walks in) I mean, yeah, maybe.", "Howard: Okay, let me feel. No, I am definitely up a cup size. ", "Raj: You know, but, but they\u2019re very firm, so you\u2019ve got that going for you.", "Howard: You think?", "Raj: Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.", "Howard: Thank you. I really needed to hear that today. (Bernadette rolls eyes and walks out) Ooh, brie\u2019s ready.", "Raj: Yay.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Good morning.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Leonard: So am I driving you to work or are you still mad at me?", "Sheldon: I\u2019d like a ride. Assuming you actually do take me to work.", "Leonard: Where do you think I would take you?", "Sheldon: Who knows? Uh, you said you\u2019d be home yesterday, but you came home three days ago. You say you\u2019re taking me to work, but for all I know, I\u2019ll end up in a deserted amusement park. Or a cornfield maze. Or a back alley dog fight. You tell me.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going to work. You can come if you want.", "Sheldon: Okay. By the way, you have something on your shirt.", "Leonard: No, I don\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Hurts, doesn\u2019t it? You know, I find myself wondering if anything you\u2019ve ever told me is true.", "Leonard: I didn\u2019t make it back. The ship sank, I\u2019m in hell.", "Sheldon: You say you\u2019re from New Jersey, but how can I believe you?", "Leonard: Why would anyone claim to be from New Jersey if they weren\u2019t?", "Sheldon: All right, I\u2019ll give you that one.", "Leonard: Hey, I said I was sorry. What else do you want from me?", "Sheldon: I want you to admit that what you did was wrong.", "Leonard: Fine. What I did was wrong.", "Sheldon: I wish I could believe you.", "Leonard: You know what? I\u2019m not driving you to work, because you\u2019re incredibly annoying.", "Sheldon: You say one thing and do the other, so then you are driving me and you find me a delight.", "Leonard: Stop it.", "Sheldon: Keep it up?", "Leonard: Bye.", "Sheldon: Hello. So I guess you\u2019re really holding up the other four fingers?", "Scene: The stairwell.", "Penny: Oh, hey, what are you doing here so early?", "Amy: Driving Sheldon to work.", "Penny: He\u2019s still mad at Leonard, huh?", "Amy: Well, he\u2019s mad at you, too. He says you\u2019re the succubus who led his friend astray.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know what succubus is, but it has suck in it, so that can\u2019t be good.", "Sheldon: Thought I heard you out here.", "Penny: Hey, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t get a hey. You get a hmm.", "Penny: Come on, don\u2019t be like that. We had so much fun together the last couple of months.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right. Which makes your betrayal all the more devastating.", "Penny: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: I let you buy feminine hygiene products with my supermarket club card. You have any idea the kind of coupons I\u2019m going to get in the mail now?", "Amy: Sheldon, your fight\u2019s with Leonard. Penny\u2019s got nothing to do\u2026", "Sheldon: Careful, Amy. The friend of my enemy\u2019s girlfriend is my enemy. ", "Amy: Really?", "Sheldon: Yes. You\u2019re either with me or against me.", "Amy: You want to take the bus to work?", "Sheldon: Maybe there\u2019s a third option.", "Amy: FYI, I had a doughnut for breakfast, you jerk.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Leonard: So now we\u2019re just waiting for the data from the ship to be crunched, but the numbers look pretty promising.", "Howard: That\u2019s so great. If you guys prove the existence of Unruh radiation\u2026 Hey, hey, hey, hey. My eyes are up here.", "Sheldon: Howard, Raj. Judas.", "Leonard: You know what? You\u2019re a crazy person.", "Sheldon: A crazy person with a long memory, and if all goes according to plan, a robot army.", "Howard: Stop it.", "Sheldon: Or a mutant army. It depends on how my Kickstarter goes.", "Howard: I said, stop it. Now, listen to me. You two aren\u2019t just friends. You\u2019re best friends. And that\u2019s a beautiful thing. I mean, Leonard, you know why he\u2019s so mad at you? It\u2019s \u2019cause he missed you. Yeah, and as his friend, you should be happy he has love in his life. As I do. This man held my breast the other day and I love him for it.", "Raj: A little loud, dude.", "Howard: So, can we please put aside these petty differences and just be glad we\u2019re here together?", "Leonard: Okay.", "Sheldon: I suppose so.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Raj: Uh, it wasn\u2019t anything weird. It was just to see how big they were.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: And then Leonard took me to the barber and the dentist, and then to cap off the perfect day, the Los Angeles Bureau of Weights and Measures. ", "Leonard: I thought the measures were going to be the stars of the show, turns out it was the weights.", "Penny: I\u2019m so glad you guys are friends again.", "Sheldon: And I\u2019m glad you and I are friends again, too.", "Penny: Aw.", "Sheldon: Which reminds me. This came in the mail, and I want you to have it.", "Penny: Fifty cents off Vagisil.", "Sheldon: Think of me when you apply it.", "Raj: Uh, can I just say, I\u2019ve missed all of us hanging out together.", "Sheldon: Yeah.", "Penny: Me, too.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: Um, since when can Koothrappali talk in front of the girls without a beer?", "\u00a0", "Bernadette: Oh, that happened right after you left.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: And no one told me?", "\u00a0", "Howard (crying): Can\u2019t believe we forgot to tell him.", "\u00a0", "Penny (handing Howard the Vagisil coupon): Think of Sheldon when you apply it.", "\u00a0"]}
