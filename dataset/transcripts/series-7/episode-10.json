{"series": "7", "episode": "10", "transcript": ["Scene: A radio studio.", "Ira Flatow: This is Science Friday. I\u2019m Ira Flatow. My guest today is responsible for the discovery of the first stable super-heavy element. Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.", "Sheldon: Thank you. Uh, the university made me come here. I didn\u2019t want to. Uh, big fan of the show.", "Ira: So, I understand that you actually discovered this element by mistake.", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Ira: And some people in the science community are calling it The Wonder Blunder.", "Sheldon: Who? Give me their names. I bet it\u2019s Wolowitz.", "Ira: It\u2019s just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It\u2019s like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure.", "Sheldon: Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?", "Ira: That\u2019s interesting, but this could be taking you down the path toward a Nobel Prize. And in chemistry, no less. And wouldn\u2019t that be unusual? Because you\u2019re a physicist.", "Sheldon: Yes, yes, I\u2019d be a physicist with a Nobel in chemistry. Everyone laugh at the circus freak. You know, I don\u2019t need to sit here and take this, Flatow. It is because of bullies like you, every day more and more Americans are making the switch to television.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is on the phone.", "Sheldon: President Seibert, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re yelling. You\u2019re the one who made me go on the radio. I was expecting a professional science interview, not an attack by some morning zoo shock jock. Well, if the university needs money so badly, perhaps you should start a swear jar. Whoa, that one\u2019s worth a dollar.", "Amy: I know you don\u2019t like it, but every time you do an interview, it raises the profile of the university. That translates to funding.", "Sheldon: Yeah, well, I\u2019m not just some trained monkey dancing for coins.", "Leonard: Of course you\u2019re not. People love trained monkeys.", "Penny: How can you not be happy? You\u2019re tall, thin and famous. Oh, my God, I\u2019m jealous of Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Look, you\u2019re gonna be doing this stuff for a while. You\u2019re just gonna have to find a way to get used to it.", "Sheldon: But none of you know what this is like. Being celebrated for something you wish you never did.", "Penny: Mmm, you clearly haven\u2019t been with me at Mardi Gras.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Want to pause the video game and help me clean up?", "Howard: I am cleaning up. Look at the mess the Joker made of Gotham City.", "Bernadette: Come on, it\u2019s your friend who\u2019s coming to stay here.", "Howard: Raj grew up in India. Trust me, he\u2019s seen worse.", "Bernadette: Howie. ", "Howard: I promise I\u2019ll help out the rest of the week.", "Bernadette: The rest of the week? You said it was just gonna be a night or two.", "Howard: Yeah, but if I told you a week, would you have said yes?", "Bernadette: No.", "Howard: Then you left me no choice.", "Bernadette: I love Raj, but that\u2019s a long time for a house guest.", "Howard: I know, but they\u2019re tenting his building. He can\u2019t find a hotel he likes that allows dogs.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s bringing Cinnamon?", "Howard: For a whole week, the nerve of some people.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon is playing with his train set.", "Sheldon: Here comes the Embarrassment Express. With stops at Fraudville, Wonder Blunderberg, and Kansas City. Because it\u2019s a hub.", "Amy: Sheldon, can I come in?", "Sheldon: Do you have cookies?", "Amy: No.", "Sheldon: Good. I don\u2019t deserve cookies. Come in. Wil?", "Wil Wheaton: Hey, Sheldon. It\u2019s been a while.", "Sheldon: Why are you here?", "Wil: Amy said you were having a rough time, and I thought maybe we could talk. Is that okay?", "Sheldon: Certainly. Although, right now, I\u2019m having a rough time because there\u2019s three people in my room, and it\u2019s starting to feel like a discotheque.", "Amy: Sheldon, you said you were unhappy getting attention for something you wished you never did.", "Wil: Yeah, I know a little something about that.", "Sheldon: Oh, nonsense, Wil. Your endless tweets are not that bad.", "Wil: I remember why it\u2019s been a while. Sheldon, I was actually talking about when I was a kid on Star Trek.", "Sheldon: How could you not like getting attention for playing Wesley Crusher? You were wonderful. A know-it-all boy genius with an eidetic memory. Who couldn\u2019t relate to that?", "Wil: Well, not everybody felt that way. A lot of people really hated the character, and some of them hated me because of it. I would do interviews, and people would be mean to me.", "Sheldon: That just happened to me. Next time you\u2019re stuck for a tweet, feel free to say what a jerk Ira Flatow is.", "Amy: Sheldon, the point is Wil learned to embrace that part of his life and moved on to bigger and better things.", "Wil: Yeah, I\u2019m an author now, I do public speaking, and I have my own Web series about board games.", "Amy: Uh, we\u2019re trying to cheer him up, so\u2026 ", "Wil: I\u2019m just saying that there was a time when I thought I would never get out of Wesley Crusher\u2019s shadow. But now, it\u2019s just one small part of a pretty great life, and it\u2019s a part that I\u2019m happy is there.", "Sheldon: I do see what you\u2019re saying. That helps.", "Wil: Good.", "Sheldon: Would you two like to stay and play trains with me?", "Wil: Sure.", "Amy: Okay.", "Sheldon: Oh, great, now, I work the controls, I say all aboard. You sit quietly and watch.", "Wil:Can I blow the whistle?", "Sheldon: You should probably go.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Howard: You\u2019re gonna brush your teeth on my couch?", "Raj: No, I\u2019m gonna brush Cinnamon\u2019s teeth.", "Howard: Why bother? She spends half the time licking her butt.", "Raj: And the other half licking my face. That\u2019s why I\u2019m brushing her teeth.", "Bernadette: Hey, guys. Sorry I\u2019m so late. Did you already have dinner?", "Howard: No, we were waiting for you.", "Bernadette: Aw, that\u2019s so sweet.", "Howard: Yeah. So what do you feel like making?", "Raj: Howard, the poor thing just got home from work. Let me get you a glass of wine. I\u2019ll cook dinner.", "Bermadette: Oh, Raj, you\u2019re our guest.", "Raj: Don\u2019t be silly. Sit. You look like you\u2019ve had a long day.", "Howard: No, she always looks like that. Because she married an idiot.", "Bernadette: Thank you, Raj.", "Raj: Please, this is my way of thanking you for letting me stay here. Now, tell us all about your day.", "Bernadette: Okay, um, well, first, I was late to a meeting \u2019cause I was stuck in traffic.", "Howard: Well, I keep telling you to put that traffic app on your phone.", "Raj: Hey, when you got home today complaining that you felt sick from eating too many jelly beans, did I tell you how to fix it? No. I said, aw, that must hurt, and I rubbed your belly.", "Howard: I thought of you the whole time.", "Raj: All I\u2019m saying is there\u2019s a time to just listen. ", "Bernadette: Thank you.", "Raj: There\u2019s also a time to stop eating too many jelly beans. And it\u2019s when you\u2019re ten.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Hello, President Siebert. Thank you for taking my call. I just wanted you to know that you can now expect enthusiastic participation from me regarding my discovery. Oh, no, no, no, no. No need to thank mNo, thank my friend, Wil Wheaton. For your information, I have nine friends, hmm? Ten if we include you. Nine it is. Ah, it\u2019s ten. I\u2019ll count Wolowitz. Hello, friend Leonard.", "Leonard: Hey, you\u2019re in a good mood.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m in a great mood.", "Leonard: Well, you\u2019re about to be in an even better one. I didn\u2019t want to say anything until I knew for sure, but, I\u2019ve been re-running the tests on your element in my lab and I disproved it. Your element does not exist.", "Sheldon: Yeah, but what about the Chinese research team? They found it.", "Leonard: Yeah, it turns out someone added simulated signals to the data files. They faked the results.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Leonard: Yes. Do you know what that means? That means all of this attention that you hate goes away.", "Sheldon: So no more interviews?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s all over.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t believe it.", "Leonard: Well, you\u2019re welcome.", "Sheldon: You robbed me of my greatest achievement.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m back down to nine friends. Make it eight, I\u2019m sick of Wolowitz, too.", "Leonard: I, I don\u2019t understand. All you\u2019ve done since you discovered this stupid element was complain. I was trying to make you happy.", "Sheldon: By taking away my only claim to fame? Well, if you wanted to make me happy, you could have told me a joke. Or shown me a cute video of a koala and an otter becoming unlikely friends.", "Leonard: Oh, there is no winning with you. And koalas and otters don\u2019t even live near each other.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s what makes their friendship unlikely,", "Penny: Hey, what\u2019s with all the yelling?", "Sheldon: Leonard disproved my element. Now all the attention is going to go away.", "Penny: Oh, that\u2019s great. You must be thrilled, ", "Sheldon: That\u2019s it, I\u2019m down to seven friends.", "Penny: He\u2019s counting hobbits and superheroes, right?", "Sheldon: When I thought the element was real, I didn\u2019t want it. But now that Leonard made it not exist, I want it more than anything in the world.", "Leonard: The, the element never existed. I didn\u2019t take it away, science took it away. Be mad at science.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t you dare use science against me. Science is my best friend. Oh, good, I\u2019m back up to eight.", "Leonard: Will you tell him he\u2019s out of his mind.", "Penny: Actually, I get what he\u2019s saying.", "Sheldon: Oh, yes, nine. Welcome back, buddy.", "Penny: It\u2019s like if you\u2019re dating someone you\u2019re not that into, and then they break up with you and then you want them more than ever.", "Sheldon: I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about, but we\u2019re ganging up on you so I agree.", "Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, what do you want me to do, hide the information? If I don\u2019t publish it, it\u2019s just a matter of time before someone else does.", "Sheldon: No, no, of course you have to publish. That\u2019s your responsibility as a scientist. Doing otherwise would be unethical. You have no choice.", "Leonard: Fine, I\u2019ll publish.", "Sheldon: Can you believe this guy?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Aw! Raj did the dishes.", "Howard: How do you know I didn\u2019t do them?", "Bernadette: Because once, when all the knives were dirty, you cut a bagel with your keys.", "Raj: Good morning, everybody. I picked up coffee while I was out. Bernadette, here\u2019s your soy peppermint mocha.", "Bernadette: Aw, you didn\u2019t have to do that.", "Raj: Oh, my pleasure, and don\u2019t worry about your presentation today. You\u2019re gonna be great.", "Howard: Yeah, you\u2019re gonna knock it out of the park.", "Bernadette: What presentation do I have today?", "Howard: Just go.", "Raj: He loves you.", "Howard: What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look bad?", "Raj: I\u2019m just being a good house guest.", "Howard: No, you\u2019re being a better husband than I am. Doing the dishes, getting coffee, knowing about her life, who does that?", "Raj: Oh, come on, I brought you one, too.", "Howard: I don\u2019t want coffee.", "Raj: That\u2019s why I got you hot chocolate.", "Howard: Give me that. Just stop showing me up.", "Raj: Howard, listen to me. You\u2019re a great husband. Yes, your listening skills could use some work. But it\u2019s amazing how far you\u2019ve come given that you\u2019re an only child raised by an over-protective mom.", "Howard: Um, is this getting weird?", "Raj: Hang on.", "Howard: So, yes.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Leonard: Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I, I posted my findings.", "Sheldon: I saw. And I just posted a retraction of my paper. Now the whole scientific community knows I was wrong.", "Leonard: These things happen all the time, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Not to me. The only other retraction I ever had to issue was when I was seven and I conceded that my brother was the greatest ninja in East Texas. But that was just a ploy to get my face out of his armpit.", "Barry: Thew he is. It\u2019s my favowite superhewo, the Wetwactor.", "Leonard: Come on, don\u2019t give him a hard time.", "Barry: I\u2019m sowwy, Cooper. I wetwact it. By the way, Hofstadter, nice job dispwoving the Chinese team.", "Leonard: It\u2019s not a big deal.", "Barry: It\u2019s a huge deal. Cooper, maybe physics just isn\u2019t your thing. Have you ever considered a caweer in wetail? That way you could take things back for a wiving.", "Leonard: Okay, Barry, that\u2019s enough.", "Sheldon: No, no, no, that\u2019s okay. I can fight my own battles. Isn\u2019t that right, Bawwy.", "Barry: Is? Is that a wefewence to my speech impediment? That\u2019s pwetty hurtful. I, I can\u2019t contwol it.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right, That was uncalled for. I take it back.", "Barry: Of course you do. Because you\u2019re the Wetwactor.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: Raj, this dinner was amazing. If you\u2019re here much longer, I\u2019m gonna have to buy bigger clothes.", "Raj: Nonsense. You need a little fattening up. You\u2019ve been looking too skinny lately.", "Bernadette: Aw. Howie, how come you never say anything sweet like that?", "Howard: What are you talking about? Remember last week, when I asked you if you were wearing Spanx and you weren\u2019t? How\u2019s that different?", "Bernadette: Maybe you could try being more thoughtful, like your friend Raj.", "Howard: Yeah, well, maybe you could try being more like Raj. ", "Bernadette: Oh, really?", "Howard: Yeah, yeah. He packed me a lunch this morning. And there was a note inside that said go get \u2019em.", "Bernadette: Like I don\u2019t do enough around here. Now I need to pack your lunch? And by the way, why do you need a note telling you to go get \u2019em? You\u2019re a grown man, you should know to go get \u2019em.", "Howard: I do know to go get \u2019em, but sometimes it\u2019s nice to have emotional support when I\u2019m going and getting them.", "Raj: Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves? Let\u2019s just, you know, all calm down and take a step back.", "Bernadette: This is stupid. Why are we fighting?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. I guess I was just feeling like I\u2019m a lousy husband.", "Bernadette: You\u2019re not a lousy husband. You\u2019re a great husband. I was the one feeling like a lousy wife.", "Howard: Are you kidding? You\u2019re the best. I know what the problem is. It\u2019s him.", "Raj: Oh, what did I do?", "Howard: You made us feel like we\u2019re not trying hard enough.", "Bernadette: Yeah, we were totally fine half-assing our marriage till you showed up.", "Raj: Look, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re upset with me, but I just have to say it\u2019s nice to see the two of you on the same page.", "Howard: Oh, it does feel good to have you backing me up for once.", "Bernadette: I back you up all the time.", "Howard: That is not\u2026 he\u2019s doing it again. ", "Bernadette: What is wrong with you?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: I can\u2019t believe they kicked you out. ", "Raj: I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re still married. Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon\u2019s toothbrush at Howard\u2019s. I guess you\u2019re sharing with Daddy again. ", "Penny: Bark once if you need me to call PETA.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s that animal doing in our apartment?", "Leonard: Oh, relax, she\u2019s in her crate. She can\u2019t get out.", "Sheldon: I have two words for you, Jurassic Park. This day just keeps getting worse and worse.", "Penny: You know, if it makes you feel any better\u2026", "Sheldon: It probably won\u2019t.", "Penny: You\u2019re probably right.", "Amy: Sheldon, it\u2019s a beautiful night. Why don\u2019t you and I go for a nice walk together?", "Sheldon: Oh, everything is just sex with you isn\u2019t it?", "Raj: Sheldon, I think you might find the support you\u2019re looking for if you realize that relationships are a give and take. She can only be there for you as much as you are for her.", "Amy: Thank you, Rajesh.", "Raj: And, Amy, you need to be patient with Sheldon, instead of pressuring him to accept intimacy on your terms.", "Amy: You should probably go.", "Scene: The radio studio.", "Ira: I\u2019m Ira Flatow, and this is Science Friday. I\u2019d like to welcome back Dr. Sheldon Cooper, who thought he had discovered a new super-heavy element only to have it disproved by my next guest, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter. Welcome to Science< Friday, gentlemen.", "Leonard: Thanks.", "Sheldon: Thank you. Ira, if I may, I\u2019d like to apologize for my behaviour last week.", "Ira: It\u2019s all right.", "Sheldon: Now, isn\u2019t there something you\u2019d like to say to me?", "Ira: No. Now, Dr. Hofstadter. Can you walk us through the process you used to disprove his theory?", "Leonard: Well\u2026", "Sheldon: I believe I can answer that.", "Leonard: He asked me.", "Sheldon: Fine.", "Leonard: As I was saying\u2026", "Sheldon: You\u2019re telling it wrong. Ira, to really understand the story here, you have to start at the very beginning. A small town in East Texas, where a young genius named\u2026", "Leonard: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s right, Sheldon Cooper. He was bitten by his neighbour\u2019s dog, leading to his first scientific breakthrough, the doggie death-ray. Which, sadly, he couldn\u2019t build because Santa wouldn\u2019t bring him enriched uranium.", "Ira: You know, I\u2019d really like to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter, if it\u2019s okay with you.", "Sheldon: What a surprise. Did you invite me back just so you could ignore me?", "Ira: Actually, I didn\u2019t invite you. You came in, you took a seat, and I\u2019m not comfortable with confrontation.", "Leonard: Sheldon, this interview is supposed to be about me.", "Sheldon: Well, that seems like a snooze. Even for public radio.", "Penny (listening in her apartment): You know, if we did a shot every time they said something embarrassing, this would be one hell of a drinking game.", "Amy: A little early for alcohol, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: You know, I don\u2019t just say smart things about science. I also yodel. (Does)", "Amy: I\u2019ll get the vodka."]}
