{"series": "7", "episode": "04", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: So what\u2019d you think?", "Amy: It was good.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s it? Good\u201d", "Amy: I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be losing my virginity, I didn\u2019t think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time.", "Sheldon: My apologies. I chose my words poorly. I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it. It\u2019s one of my all-time favourites.", "Amy: It was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem.", "Sheldon: Story problem? You, oh, Amy, what a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are. Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation. I\u2019ve watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it\u2019s still light out, but, I defy you to find a story problem. Here\u2019s my jaw, drop it.", "Amy: All right. Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story. If he weren\u2019t in the film, it would turn out exactly the same.", "Sheldon: Oh, I see your confusion. You don\u2019t understand. Indiana Jones was the one in the hat with the whip.", "Amy: No, I do, and if he weren\u2019t in the movie, the Nazis would have still found the ark, taken it to the island, opened it up and all died, just like they did. Let me close that for ya.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The foyer.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hi. I thought you went to the comic book store on Wednesdays.", "Leonard: Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy were having date night and they don\u2019t need me there to make it awkward. They have each other for that. So, how was school?", "Penny: Oh, good. Check it out, The Disappointing Child by Beverly Hofstadter.", "Leonard: You bought my mom\u2019s book?", "Penny: Yeah. It\u2019s on the recommended reading list for my psychology class.", "Leonard: Oh, come on. Not that book. It, it\u2019s got, like, every horrible story from my childhood in it.", "Penny: Oh, cool. Are there pictures?", "Leonard: Seriously, please find another book.", "Penny: Oh, come on. Why? How bad could it be?", "Leonard: There, there\u2019s chapters about potty training, and bed-wetting and masturbation. Basically, if something came out of me, she wrote about it. You know what? Do whatever you want, just don\u2019t talk to me about it.", "Penny: Not even the chapter on the breast-feeding crisis?", "Leonard: It was not a crisis. Apparently, I favoured the left one, she got a little lopsided.", "Penny: Oh, my God, you still go left.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Raj: Which celebrity would you say I look like the most?", "Howard: Halle Berry. Why?", "Raj: Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it\u2019s one of the questions. And thank you, I\u2019d kill for that woman\u2019s bone structure.", "Leonard: Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll tell you why. Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I\u2019m trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.", "Howard: Because her life wasn\u2019t enough?", "Raj: Wait, how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders? It\u2019s perfect.", "Sheldon: Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story. With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.", "All: Aw!", "Howard: Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis were digging in the wrong place. The only reason they got the ark was because Indy found it first.", "Leonard: Actually, they were only digging in the wrong place because Indy had the medallion. Without him, they would have had the medallion and dug in the right place.", "All: Aw!", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Okay, I know you don\u2019t want to talk about it, but can I just ask you one question about your mom\u2019s book?", "Leonard: No.", "Penny: I just want to know why a five-year-old boy puts on his mom\u2019s make-up and wears balloon boobies.", "Leonard: They weren\u2019t boobies, they were muscles. And the make-up was green. I was pretending to be The Hulk.", "Penny: You were wearing her bra.", "Leonard: That was to keep my muscles from sagging. Can we please stop talking about this?", "Penny: Okay, okay. But you know, as a student of psychology who got a check-plus on her first homework assignment, I think, sometimes, it\u2019s good to open up about these things.", "Leonard: Okay, fine. Do you want to know why I dressed like The Hulk? Because I was always mad at my mom and I wanted to smash my way out of that house.", "Penny: Well, why were you so angry?", "Leonard: Gee, I don\u2019t know. Maybe it\u2019s because I was always the subject of her little experiments. Did you get to the chapter where she staged the Easter egg hunt with no eggs to see how long I\u2019d keep looking? The answer, by the way, June.", "Penny: Sweetie, I\u2019m so sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make you feel better.", "Leonard: I do, too, but there\u2019s not.", "Penny: Really? Are you sure about that?", "Leonard: Of course, who am I to argue with a check-plus student? Just warning you, I\u2019m gonna go right. Don\u2019t make a big deal out of it.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Stuart: Is make-up really necessary?", "Raj: Well, when someone looks at your dating profile, the first thing they see is your picture. I just want to make sure you look fun and full of life and not like a body they just pulled out of the river. All right, here we go, and smile. Okay, uh-uh, that one\u2019s in the bank. How about this? Turn away, and then turn back into it. But when you do, imagine the camera is the girl you want to meet.", "Stuart: You got it.", "Raj: Okay, uh, let\u2019s try it again. Uh, but this time, pretend the girl you want to meet doesn\u2019t want to hurt you.", "Stuart: I don\u2019t think I can give you that.", "Raj: Come on. One more time. Yeah, it\u2019s, it\u2019s a little blurry, but I think that works in your favour. Do you want a beer?", "Stuart: Sure. Hey, have you finished writing your profile yet?", "Raj: Almost. Oh, what did you put as the one-word description of yourself?", "Stuart: I put unobjectionable. But now that I hear it out loud, it just seems like I\u2019m being cocky. What did you put for your best feature?", "Raj: My parents\u2019 money. Uh, what did you put for your best feature?", "Stuart: I put: not applicable.", "Raj: Come on, dude, you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You\u2019ve got a lot of good stuff going on.", "Stuart: Really? Like what?", "Raj: Well, okay, you\u2019re a, you\u2019re a talented artist, you own your own business.", "Stuart: Neither of those things have ever helped me meet a woman.", "Raj: Okay, well, can we imply that you\u2019re well-endowed?", "Stuart: I do have one oddly long testicle.", "Raj: Okay, now you\u2019re talking like a winner!", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Whatcha doin\u2019?", "Sheldon: Oh, it turns out Amy\u2019s beloved Pride and Prejudice is a flawless masterpiece. He\u2019s got too much pride, she\u2019s got too much prejudice, it just works.", "Leonard: So you\u2019re looking to ruin something for her in the funny pages?", "Sheldon: Amy has a fondness for the comic strip Marmaduke.", "Leonard: Mm-hmm. And?", "Sheldon: And I think I\u2019ve got it. Consider, a family possesses a dog that is so large and poorly disciplined, he causes nothing but problems. Why do they keep him?", "Leonard: Maybe they fell in love with him as a puppy and didn\u2019t know how big he was gonna be.", "Sheldon: Of course. You know, why couldn\u2019t she just like Ziggy? Yeah? That thing\u2019s riddled with plot holes.", "Leonard: Sorry, buddy.", "Sheldon: Ooh, I think she\u2019s a fan of Garfield as well. Oh, darn it, now so am I.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll see you later. I gotta go watch a stupid football game with Penny.", "Sheldon: Wait, hang on. You\u2019ve spent time with Amy. Can you think of anything she\u2019s fond of that has a bunch of flaws she hasn\u2019t noticed?", "Leonard: I gotta go.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: You ready to go?", "Penny: Yep. Hey, and maybe this time you don\u2019t try and talk sports with the guys.", "Leonard: Some sports bar. It\u2019s like they never even heard of Quidditch. Do we really have to go?", "Penny: Oh, come on. Every time we\u2019re about to hang out with my friends, you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s like, It\u2019s too loud, or the bathroom\u2019s too dirty, or they put a chicken wing in my ear. I mean\u2026", "Leonard: Well, you\u2019re, you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s just go.", "Penny: Hey, what\u2019s going on with you?", "Leonard: Nothing, I\u2019m fine.", "Penny: All right, hang on. is this still about your mom\u2019s book?", "Leonard: No. Not everything is about my mom. ", "Penny: \u2018Cause if you\u2019re still upset about that, we don\u2019t have to go.", "Leonard: Except this is totally about my mom.", "Penny: I\u2019m so sorry. I never should have read that book. You know what? You want to just get dinner and watch the game here?", "Leonard: That sounds nice. Yeah.", "Penny: Okay.", "Leonard: Or, you know, we could get take-out and watch the Blu-ray extended version of The Hobbit movie with commentary track. On account of how sad I am about my mom.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s lab.", "Howard: Leonard, you ready for lunch?", "Leonard: One sec. Hey. Sorry.", "Howard: Hi, Penny.", "Penny: Hi. All right, sweetie. You hang in there today.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll try, but I might be sad again tonight.", "Penny: Okay.", "Howard: Wow. Sex at work?", "Leonard: Leave it alone. That\u2019s my girlfriend.", "Howard: Sorry. ", "Leonard: Who just had sex with me at work.", "Howard: Damn. How\u2019d you swing that?", "Leonard: Well, whenever I talk about how awful my mom was, Penny will do anything to make me feel better.", "Howard: Seriously?", "Leonard: Look, I mean, I\u2019m not proud of it, but it does work. I got her to watch a six-part documentary on Monty Python. Even I was bored, I just wanted to see if she\u2019d make it to the end.", "Howard: You sound kind of proud of it.", "Leonard: I am, I\u2019m really proud.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy (on webcam): Hello, Sheldon. Is everything okay?", "Sheldon: Yes. Why?", "Amy: Well, the last time you made an unscheduled video-chat, there was a curly fry in your regular fries and you thought someone might be trying to slip you a mickey.", "Sheldon: April 13, a dark night, indeed.", "Amy: So what can I do for you?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m calling to invite you to a spontaneous date night tomorrow evening.", "Amy: Really?", "Sheldon: Yes. You were kind enough to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark with me. So I\u2019d like to return the favour by inviting you to watch an episode of your favourite childhood television series, Little House on the Prairie.", "Amy: That sounds lovely. Why are you rubbing your hands together?", "Sheldon: Um, I\u2019m putting on lotion. Are you in or not?", "Amy: Of course I\u2019m in.", "Sheldon: Excellent. Then I shall see you tomorrow. Good night, Dr. Fowler.", "Amy: Good night, Dr. Cooper.", "Sheldon: Good night, indeed. What a rube. Why would I put on lotion when I have such soft hands?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s apartment.", "Bernadette: You were really quiet during dinner. Is everything okay?", "Howard: Yeah. I guess I was just thinking about my mom, and how sad my childhood was.", "Bernadette: Yeah, I bet it sucked. I\u2019m gonna take a bath, you do the dishes.", "Howard: How about I take a bath with you and see what happens.", "Bernadette: Here\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. I\u2019m gonna take a bath, and you\u2019re gonna do the dishes.", "Howard: That\u2019s it? No compassion?", "Bernadette: Aw, poor Howie. We good? I\u2019m gonna take a bath.", "Howard: Bernie\u2026", "Bernadette: God, what is going on with you? ", "Howard: I\u2019m sharing my pain.", "Bernadette: And I\u2019m not buying it. Try again.", "Howard: I\u2019m learning to be a man in a culture where it\u2019s increasingly difficult to know how?", "Bermadette: Strike two.", "Howard: I\u2019m copying Leonard. When he does this to Penny, they have sex and watch Monty Python.", "Bernadette: Howard.", "Howard: I know. It was dumb, I shouldn\u2019t have done it. And it\u2019s making me feel sad. So sad. You know, why don\u2019t you take a bath? I\u2019ll do the dishes.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Raj: Three, two, one. ", "Stuart: That\u2019s it. Our dating profiles are live on the Internet.", "Raj: Attention all shoppers, my business is open for business!", "Stuart: That\u2019s right, ladies. For all you know, I\u2019m confident and fun to be around.", "Raj: Oh, cool, it tells you when someone\u2019s reading your profile. Jenny309. I hope that\u2019s not her weight. ", "Stuart: If it is, I\u2019ll take her. Ooh, I got one, too. The ladies are coming to us. Oh, man, if I\u2019d started this years ago, I\u2019d be divorced two or three times by now.", "Raj: What? Another one. You know, it, it\u2019s weird. When they\u2019re reading your profile, does it, does it make you feel exposed? Like they see you naked?", "Stuart: Well, they\u2019re not running away screaming, so, no.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Amy: I love Little House. It made me want to live on a farm so much I tried to milk my cat. That tangy bowl of Cheerios was not worth the stitches.", "Sheldon: Well, you sit back, relax and enjoy a beloved childhood memory. You see that cabin there? I read they were illegally squatting on Indian land. Yeah. Personally, I think what we did to the Native Americans was wrong, but this is your favourite show, not mine. Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls, eating that peanut butter sandwich. Peanut butter? Huh? That\u2019s strange, since peanut butter wasn\u2019t introduced until the early 1900s. If I knew this show was about time travel, I would have watched it much sooner.", "Amy: You\u2019re trying to get back at me for what I said about Raiders of the Lost Ark.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s silly. Almost as silly as Dr. Baker having a telephone, since telephones only existed in large cities at that time. This is more like Little House on the Preposterous.", "Amy: Sheldon, we\u2019re in a relationship. When you get angry, just tell me. You don\u2019t need to seek revenge.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? Every time my dad stayed out all night, my mom would put hamster poop in his chewing tobacco.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s not how we\u2019re going to do it.", "Sheldon: Fine. I\u2019m mad at you. Not only did you ruin Raiders for me, you may have ruined the whole franchise. Except for the fourth one, which was bad before you got your mitts on it.", "Amy: I shouldn\u2019t have said it. I\u2019m sorry.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: Do you feel better?", "Sheldon: Yes. But not as good as I\u2019m going to when I tell you that your precious Garfield has no reason to hate Mondays. He\u2019s a cat. He doesn\u2019t have a job.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: Hey, I was just\u2026 what is happening?", "Penny: Oh, just a little treat. I know you\u2019ve been feeling really bad about your mom lately.", "Leonard: Oh, oh, I have. So bad.", "Penny: And I wanted to make you feel better, so I planned something very special for you.", "Leonard: Uh-huh, I can already feel it working.", "Mrs Hofstadter (on webcam): Hello, Leonard.", "Leonard: Mom?", "Mrs Hofstadter: I understand you have been whining about my parenting in order to emotionally manipulate your girlfriend. ", "Leonard: I\u2026 uh\u2026", "Penny: Bernadette told me everything. Now you don\u2019t get the left or the right.", "Mrs Hofstadter: Let\u2019s discuss why you continue to involve me in your sex life.", "Leonard: Oh, please, Mommy. No, Mommy.", "Mrs Hofstadter: When you were six years old, you walked in on me and your father naked. I was swatting his bottom with your brand new Ping Pong paddle.", "Leonard: I didn\u2019t dream that?", "Mrs Hofstadter: How did that make you feel?", "Leonard: Penny, come back. I\u2019m sad for real now.", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment. ", "Raj: In the last two hours, 162 women have read our profiles. How many of them have sent us messages?", "Stuart: Combined?", "Raj: Yes.", "Stuart: Zero.", "Raj: Dude, this is, this is brutal. ", "Stuart: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so rejected. And I had a rescue dog who ran back to the pound.", "Raj: This is the worst. If we\u2019re gonna get shot down, we might as well just go to a bar and do it old school.", "Stuart: And make them look us in the eye.", "Raj: Yeah, anything is better than this.", "Scene: A bar. ", "Raj: Hello.", "Girl: Not interested.", "Raj: I was wrong. This is worse.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Howard: Wait, wait, if it wasn\u2019t for Indiana Jones, the ark would never have ended up at the warehouse. ", "Sheldon: That\u2019s true. He collected and delivered the ark to the proper authorities for filing.", "Raj: Like a hero.", "All: Yeah!", "Leonard: Although, technically, Indy was supposed to take the ark to a museum to be studied. He couldn\u2019t even get that done.", "All: Aw!"]}
