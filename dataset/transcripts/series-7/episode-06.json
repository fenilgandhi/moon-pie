In the zone.", "Penny: Do you know what he\u2019s doing?", "Amy: Could be anything. Last time he was like this, he figured out electron transport in graphene. The time before that, he was making a list of who\u2019s allowed in his tree fort if fe ever gets one. Still can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t make the cut.", "Penny: Uh, Sheldon, you want to take a break? Your food\u2019s ready.", "Leonard: No, no, what are you doing? He\u2019s both happy and quiet. It\u2019s like seeing a unicorn and Bigfoot at the same time.", "Howard: Sorry we\u2019re so late. Bernadette got stuck at work.", "Bernadette: Great news. A raccoon virus just crossed the species barrier and now can infect humans.", "Raj: Why is that great news?", "Bernadette: In the pharmaceutical business we have a saying, mo\u2019 infections, mo\u2019 money.", "Howard: Wait, Maybe you want to wash your little raccoon hands first.", "Bernadette: Oh, calm down. If I had it, I\u2019d be dead already.", "Howard: Guys, listen up. ", "Sheldon: Can\u2019t listen, zone. Also don\u2019t care.", "Howard: Next week is the anniversary of my first date with Bernadette.", "Sheldon: Really don\u2019t care.", "Howard: I want to do something special, and I was hoping you guys could be a part of it.", "Penny: Aw, what horrible thing are you trying to make up for?", "Howard: Just putting something in the bank for what horrible thing I do next.", "Penny: Ah.", "Howard: Look, she\u2019s gonna be back any second, so here\u2019s the deal. I\u2019m writing a song, and I was hoping we could all play it for her together.", "Leonard: Aw.", "Amy: Oh, I love that.", "Raj: That is so beautiful.", "Howard: Sheldon?", "Sheldon: When did we get to the Cheesecake Factory?", "Credits sequence", "Scene: The stairwell", "Leonard: It\u2019s really sweet what Howard wants to do for Bernadette.", "Penny: Yeah. Hey, how come you\u2019ve never done anything romantic to celebrate our first date?", "Leonard: Well, for starters, you\u2019ve broken up with me so many times, which first date are we talking about?", "Sheldon: Ooh, somebody call the burn ward. And back to the zone.", "Leonard: And besides, I do romantic things for you all the time. Can you even name one romantic thing you\u2019ve done for me?", "Penny: I can name tons.", "Leonard: Sex doesn\u2019t count.", "Penny: Oh. I know, what about that bed-and-breakfast?", "Leonard: Well, I took you there. All you did was\u2026", "Penny: I know what I did. I bet they had to throw out that rocking chair. You know, I can be romantic if I want to.", "Leonard: It\u2019s fine. And also not true.", "Penny: Okay, just you wait and see. I\u2019m gonna romance your freakin\u2019 ass off.", "Leonard: That\u2019s beautiful. Is that Shakespeare?", "Penny: Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Zone.", "Leonard: He\u2019ll figure it out when he falls off the roof.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, I know you\u2019re in the zone, but do you want some tea? All right, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m gonna say this, but you haven\u2019t spoken in hours and I\u2019m starting to get worried. Please say something.", "Sheldon: Leonard, prepare to be humbled and weep at the glory of my genius.", "Leonard: Nope, it was better before.", "Sheldon: Look at it. I feel like my mind just made a baby. And it\u2019s beautiful. It\u2019s not like human babies, which are loud and covered in goop.", "Leonard: Holy crap, Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?", "Sheldon: Did I? Well, that can\u2019t be right. No one\u2019s ever done that before. Except me, because I just did it. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain, yeah. Sheldon and his brain\u2026", "Leonard: Yeah, definitely better before.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: So I\u2019m almost done writing the song for Bernadette. Are you cool playing the cello?", "Leonard: If by cool you mean willing to, yes. If by cool you mean cool, clearly you\u2019ve never seen me play the cello.", "Howard: Great. Will you play the ukulele?", "Raj: Of course. I\u2019d be happy to shred it on my ax.", "Howard: Or you could just play your tiny, ridiculous guitar.", "Raj: Fine. I will melt her heart. And her face.", "Sheldon: Gentlemen. Uh, no doubt you heard about my little breakthrough. Now, if your plan is to hoist me on your shoulders and carry me around the cafeteria, please refrain. I don\u2019t care for heights, motion sickness or the thought of your necks touching my buttocks. ", "Howard: Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.", "Raj: Yeah, I read your paper online. That technique for creating a new heavy element is inspired.", "Sheldon: Oh, well, thank you. Believe it or not, I just learned a Chinese research team at the Hubei Institute for Nuclear Physics ran a test on a cyclotron, and the results were extremely promising.", "Leonard: Sheldon, that\u2019s incredible.", "Sheldon: Yeah, I know. They called it the greatest thing since the Communist party. Although I\u2019m pretty sure that the Communist party made them say that. I like China. See, they know how to keep people in line.", "Howard: So, what happens next?", "Sheldon: Oh, more testing, more success, more fame. Yeah, but don\u2019t worry, I will remain the same down-to-earth humble Joe I\u2019ve always been.", "Leonard: Good to know.", "Sheldon: Now give me that cookie, I discovered an element.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: Thank you so much for coming.", "Raj: You called the right person. I believe I have the perfect romantic evening for you to give Leonard.", "Penny: Okay, good, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been really struggling with this.", "Raj: As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the quickest way to a man\u2019s heart is through his\u2026", "Penny: Pants, but Leonard says sex doesn\u2019t count.", "Raj: Oh. You poor thing. You have one arrow in your quiver, and you just can\u2019t use it. Fortunately, another pathway to a man\u2019s heart is through his stomach. ", "Penny: I don\u2019t know if I want to cook for him. He\u2019s kind of a picky eater. I mean, it\u2019s too salty, it\u2019s too dry, it\u2019s too burnt and frozen at the same time. Okay, come on, what else would sweep you off your feet?", "Raj: Well, I\u2019ve always had this fantasy that involves dancing. The sexual chemistry between my partner and me is electric. But boy, oh, boy, does my father not approve until he sees us in the big dance competition.", "Penny: Okay, that\u2019s just the plot for Dirty Dancing. What else would you love? Other than being lifted over Patrick Swayze\u2019s head.", "Raj: Oh, oh, uh, you could, uh, stand outside his window with a boom box in the air.", "Penny: That\u2019s from Say Anything.", "Raj: Look, I\u2019m a lonely guy, I watch a lot of movies. Look, Penny, if you truly want to be romantic, it needs to come from you.", "Penny: I get that, but why is this so hard?", "Raj: Well, you\u2019ve probably never had to do this stuff \u2019cause you\u2019re young and beautiful and men have always thrown themselves at you.", "Penny: Yeah, I\u2019m trying to be sad about that. I can\u2019t.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Let\u2019s see, what\u2019s next? Okay, here. This is the Magic Marker I was using when I made the discovery.", "Amy: I don\u2019t think the Smithsonian\u2019s gonna want your marker. ", "Sheldon: And that\u2019s why you\u2019re not on a list for my tree fort. Ooh, guess who\u2019s getting an article written about him in Physics Today? I\u2019ll give you a hint. You measured the diameter of his suspicious mole yesterday.", "Amy: Sheldon, I\u2019m so proud of you.", "Sheldon: Well, you should be. My discovery is spreading like wildfire. Unlike my mole, which is holding steady at the size of a navy bean.", "Amy: What\u2019s next?", "Sheldon: This is the very copy of The Handbook of Chemistry and Physics in which I looked up the reaction rates of mendelevium and\u2026", "Amy: And what?", "Sheldon: No. No, no, no, no.", "Amy: What\u2019s wrong?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve made a horrible mistake.", "Amy: What are you talking about?", "Sheldon: This table, it\u2019s in square centimetres. I read it as square metres. You know what that means?", "Amy: That Americans can\u2019t handle the metric system?", "Sheldon: Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000. ", "Amy: But the Chinese team found the element.", "Sheldon: Yeah, well, they shouldn\u2019t have. My calculations were wrong. There must be some resonance between the elements I didn\u2019t know about.", "Amy: So you just got lucky?", "Sheldon: Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky.", "Amy: You and me both, brother. It doesn\u2019t matter. The element was found because of you, and that\u2019s groundbreaking.", "Sheldon: What matters is the greatest scientific achievement of my life is based on a blunder. I\u2019m not a genius, I\u2019m a fraud.", "Amy: You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience, we\u2019re forever finding something in one part of the brain that we thought was someplace else.", "Sheldon: Oh, great. Now I\u2019m worse than a fraud. I\u2019m practically a biologist.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Leonard:: You got to stop beating yourself up over this. I mean, you made a mistake, but it was a happy mistake.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s nothing happy about it. I\u2019m being given credit that I don\u2019t deserve. ", "Leonard: Oh, people get things they don\u2019t deserve all the time. Look at me with you. ", "Sheldon: No, Leonard, this is going to haunt me for the rest of my life. Every science classroom, every periodic table, every textbook, this mistake will be staring back at me. Like that time you let Koothrappali wax your eyebrows. I\u2019ve got to find a way to stop this thing.", "Leonard: Buddy, I don\u2019t think you can. I mean, once it\u2019s out there, it\u2019s out there. This thing is like the science equivalent of a sex tape.", "Sheldon: You know, frankly, I\u2019d prefer a sex tape.", "Leonard: You don\u2019t know what a sex tape is, do you?", "Sheldon: No.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: Make sure you guys get to the restaurant by eight. Bernadette\u2019s meeting me there at eight thirty and I don\u2019t want to blow the surprise.", "Leonard: We\u2019ll be there.", "Raj: Got it. Now, uh, I have a question about the song. I was thinking at some point I could bust out a little rap.", "Howard: E-Ni-Ni-Ni-Ni-No.", "Raj: Come on, come on, you haven\u2019t even heard it yet. Leonard, give me a beat.", "Leonard: I will not.", "Raj: Oh, please?", "Howard: No, I want this to be romantic.", "Raj: It will be. I don\u2019t call anyone a ho, and the only time I use the phrase my bitch, I\u2019m referring to you.", "Voice: There he is. (General applause) ", "Sheldon: Stop it. Stop celebrating me.", "Voice: Woo!", "Sheldon: And no woos. Oh, not you, Dr. Woo. You\u2019re fine. I want you all to know that you have no reason to applaud me. My so-called breakthrough wasn\u2019t the result of my genius. It was nothing more than a boneheaded mistake. So please refrain from praising me for it in the future.", "Raj: Wait, I don\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t find the element?", "Sheldon: Oh, no, they found the element. (More applause) No, no, stop it. I don\u2019t need to take this admiration from the likes of you people. How do I make them stop loving me?", "Leonard: Invite them to live with us.", "Scene: A restaurant.", "Penny: Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.", "Leonard: Yeah. It must be nice to have someone do something so romantic.", "Penny: Okay, you know what\u2019s not romantic? Rubbing it in someone\u2019s face.", "Leonard: Actually, it can be, but I told you sex doesn\u2019t count.", "Howard: I\u2019m getting worried about Bernadette. I\u2019m gonna call and check on her.", "Sheldon: The National Science Foundation wants to give me a substantial grant.", "Raj: Oh, that\u2019s a big deal.", "Sheldon: I know. When will this nightmare end?", "Leonard: Hey, I get that you feel bad about all the attention, but still, what you did is amazing. We\u2019re really proud of you.", "Amy: I\u2019m not.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re not?", "Amy: Sheldon, I\u2019ve been thinking about it, and you\u2019re right. You don\u2019t deserve any credit. All you did was misread some numbers on a table. A very easy table, too. Honestly, I\u2019m embarrassed for you.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s the most romantic thing I\u2019ve ever heard.", "Penny: Damn it, everyone\u2019s better at this than me.", "Sheldon: Congratulations, Dr. Fowler. You just made the fort.", "Howard: Guys, there was an accident at Bernie\u2019s lab.", "Leonard: Oh, my God, is she okay?", "Howard: Yeah, but she\u2019s at the hospital in quarantine.", "Penny: What?", "Amy: Poor Bernadette.", "Leonard: Oh, no.", "Sheldon: I hate to pile on the bad news, but I just got a raise.", "Scene: The hospital. ", "Howard: Oh, my God, Bernie, what happened?", "Bernadette: Well, let\u2019s just say the next time you move a dozen vials of raccoon virus to the fridge, make two trips. ", "Howard: You\u2019re sure you\u2019re okay?", "Bernadette: Yeah, it\u2019s just a precaution. If there was a problem, I\u2019d be throwing up out of my eyeballs by now. Sorry I messed up our date.", "Howard: Oh, don\u2019t worry about it. I brought the date here. Guys, come on in.", "Bernadette: What\u2019s all this?", "Howard: Well, tonight is the anniversary of our first date, and I wanted to celebrate it by writing a song for you.", "Bernadette: Howie.", "Amy: Sheldon, get over here.", "Sheldon: She might be contagious. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m having a rough enough day?", "Amy: Sheldon.", "Howard (singing): If I didn\u2019t have you, life would be blue, I\u2019d be Dr. Who without the TARDIS.", "Sheldon: Is it me, or does she not look so good?", "Amy: Shh.", "Howard: A candle without a wick, a Watson without a Crick, I\u2019d be one of my outfits without a dick-ie. I\u2019d be cheese without the mac, Jobs without the Wozniak, I\u2019d be solving exponential equations that use bases not found on your calculator making it much harder to crack. I\u2019d be an atom without a bomb, a dot without the com, and I\u2019d probably still live with my mom.", "All: And he\u2019d probably still live with his mom.", "Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You supported all my dreams and all my hopes. You\u2019re like uranium-235 and I\u2019m uranium-238, almost inseparable isotopes. I couldn\u2019t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you Bernadette.", "Bernadette: Oh, Howie.", "Howard: If I didn\u2019t have you life would be dreary, I\u2019d be string theory without any string. I\u2019d be binary code without a one, a cathode ray tube without an electron gun. I\u2019d be Firefly, Buffy and Avengers without Joss Whedon. I\u2019d speak a lot more Klingon, Heghlu\u2019meH QaQ jajvam. ", "All: And he\u2019d definitely still live with his mom.", "Howard: Ever since I met you, you turned my world around. You\u2019re my best friend and my lover. We\u2019re like changing electric and magnetic fields. You can\u2019t have one without the other. I couldn\u2019t have imagined how good my life would get from the moment that I met you, Bernadette.", "All: Oh, we couldn\u2019t have imagined how good our lives would get from the moment that we met you, Bernadette.", "Bernadette: Howie, that was amazing. Look, I\u2019m shaking.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s sick, I knew it. Bye.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Leonard: I have to say, this is the best Top Ramen you\u2019ve ever made.", "Penny: I discovered a secret ingredient. The flavour packet. That sucker is well named. All right, lover boy, get ready, \u2019cause there is a crap storm of romance coming your way.", "Leonard: Stop it, you\u2019re gonna make me cry. All right. You seem pretty confident.", "Penny: Oh, I am. Maybe if you follow this trail, you\u2019ll see why.", "Leonard: Oh, rose petals.", "Penny: Yes. The most beautiful and shockingly expensive of all the flowers.", "Leonard: You made the bed? You really are pulling out all the stops.", "Penny: Okay, I gave this a lot of thought, and I finally found something to show you how much I love you.", "Leonard: Oh, wow.", "Penny: It\u2019s a first edition of Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy. I remember it was your favourite book growing up.", "Leonard: This is great. It, thank you, it\u2019s, so much.", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: Nothing. I love it.", "Penny: No. Something\u2019s going on. What\u2019s wrong with it? I remember you saying how great it would be to have a first edition.", "Leonard: It\u2019s true, I did. I did say that. When we were at the used bookstore together and I saw the first edition and I bought it.", "Penny: Oh, my God, I am the worst.", "Leonard: No, no, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s really thoughtful.", "Penny: No, it\u2019s not. I mean, what\u2019s thoughtful is everything you do. Here, you know what? Look at this. Look, here\u2019s the, the plane ticket you bought me when I was too poor to go home for the holidays. And the rose you left on my windshield just because. Here\u2019s the, the thank-you letter you wrote me after the first time I slept with you. All 11 pages of it.", "Leonard: I can\u2019t believe you saved all this stuff.", "Penny: Of course I did. It\u2019s you.", "Leonard: Come here.", "Penny: Oh.", "Leonard: Is that a pregnancy test?", "Penny: Oh, yeah, just the first one. I didn\u2019t save them all.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t believe I read this table wrong. I blame you.", "Amy: Me? What did I do?", "Sheldon: You distract me. I\u2019ve been distracted since the moment I met you. ", "Amy: Sorry.", "Sheldon: Well, you should be. Because all I can think about is how much I want to kiss you. And not just on the cheek, but on the mouth. Like mommies and daddies do.", "Amy: Oh, Sheldon.", "Sheldon (not in Amy\u2019s daydream, now in the Cheesecake Factory): Amy? Amy? Did you hear what I said?", "Amy: Can\u2019t talk, in the zone."]}
