{"series": "10", "episode": "04", "transcript": ["Scene: The foyer.", "Amy: And there was water everywhere, it was such a mess.", "Leonard: That stinks. How long are you out of the apartment?", "Amy: About five weeks.", "Penny: Ugh, did you lose anything valuable?", "Amy: Well, the pipe was over my closet, so all my clothes are gone.", "Penny: Oh, so nothing. Great. Do they know why the pipe burst?", "Amy: They didn\u2019t say.", "Leonard: Buildings that have a combination of copper and galvanized steel are susceptible to pinholes and corrosion caused by the mobility of ions in the water. Can\u2019t have your head shoved in a toilet as much as I did and not pick up a few things about plumbing.", "Penny: Well, if you need a place to crash, you can stay with us.", "Amy: Really?", "Penny: Of course. You can stay in Leonard\u2019s room, and we\u2019ll stay at my place.", "Amy: You\u2019re sure that\u2019s not an inconvenience?", "Penny: No, not at all.", "Leonard: And we live with Sheldon, so the word inconvenience has really lost all meaning.", "Amy: So, technically, I\u2019d be moving in with my boyfriend?", "Penny: I guess so. And I\u2019d finally get to live alone with my husband.", "Amy: Oh, my, this is a big step.", "Leonard: Mm-hmm. For two of us, it\u2019s in the right direction.", "Sheldon: Why are you all smiling like crazy people?", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Sheldon: Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That\u2019s a great deal to process.", "Leonard: It\u2019s only for five weeks.", "Penny: Yeah, and we\u2019ll be right across the hall.", "Amy: What do you think?", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know. What if living together kills the romance?", "Penny: Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.", "Sheldon: Yeah, but what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain? I mean, she\u2019s never even seen me unshaven.", "Leonard: You just shaved yesterday. You\u2019re good for three months.", "Amy: Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you. Given the five-week end date, isn\u2019t it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment and collect data on our compatibility?", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t try luring me in with sexy talk.", "Leonard: Okay. Star Trek, the original series, the Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds. Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.", "Sheldon: If you want to lure me in with sexy talk, that\u2019s how you do it.", "Penny: Don\u2019t be proud of that.", "Amy: So, is that a yes?", "Sheldon: Not yet. How will I learn if I\u2019m comfortable living with Amy or just comfortable because I\u2019m in my own apartment? Now, if this experiment is going to be valid, I suggest a neutral environment.", "Penny: Well, where would you go?", "Sheldon: Well, ideally, an enclosed, self-sustaining biodome in New Mexico, where we would eat crops fertilized with our own waste. ", "Leonard: And you were worried about the romance. 00:03:18,914", "Penny: Wait. Why don\u2019t you guys stay across the hall, and we will live here?", "Sheldon: Interesting. If my official residence were across the hall, I wonder if I\u2019d need to knock every time I came over here.", "Leonard: That\u2019s a good question. Maybe just don\u2019t come over.", "Sheldon: Historically, I don\u2019t do well with change.", "Penny: Okay, it won\u2019t be that bad. We wouldn\u2019t even sit in your spot while you\u2019re gone.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re darn right, you wouldn\u2019t. No matter where I am, this will always be my spot. Like an embassy in a foreign country, this seat is the sovereign soil of my bottom.", "Leonard: Just nod and smile. He\u2019s almost gone.", "Amy: Sheldon, what do you think?", "Sheldon: Very well. I\u2019m on board.", "Amy: Seriously?", "Sheldon: Yes. I accept this five-week mission to share a living space with my girlfriend.", "Amy: Oh. This is so exciting.", "Sheldon: Well, now, don\u2019t be surprised if, like Star Trek, it\u2019s cancelled in three.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Raj: I have to say, I am happy with your OBGYN.", "Howard: Cool. \u2018Cause she says you\u2019re doing a great job as weird friend who doesn\u2019t have to be at every appointment.", "Raj: I\u2019m the son of a gynaecologist. I could be helpful. ", "Bernadette: It would help if you stopped telling me I have a textbook cervix.", "Raj: The polite response is, thank you for noticing.", "Bernadette: Let me see the sonogram again. Oh, yeah, that\u2019s a good-looking baby for a little grey blob.", "Howard: Yeah, we could name him Blobert.", "Bernadette: What if it\u2019s a girl?", "Howard: Bloberta. Or Blobbi with an I.", "Bernadette: Are we being silly not finding out the sex?", "Howard: Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing.", "Raj: If you want, you can find out right now.", "Howard: Mm.", "Bernadette: Hmm. The doctor\u2019s gone for the day, so it doesn\u2019t matter.", "Raj: Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.", "Bernadette: You looked in our folder?!", "Raj: It was an accident. The doctor left the folder out on her desk. It\u2019s not my fault I opened it and looked.", "Howard: So you know the sex of our baby, and we don\u2019t?", "Raj: Flip a coin. You got a fifty-fifty shot.", "Howard: It\u2019s unbelievable.", "Bernadette: God, Raj.", "Raj: What? This is not a problem, okay? If you don\u2019t want to know, I don\u2019t have to tell you.", "Bernadette: We don\u2019t want you to know.", "Raj: Okay, well, that\u2019s a problem.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: You know, I\u2019m very proud of you for trying to live with Amy.", "Sheldon: Oh. Thank you.", "Penny: Mm. ", "Sheldon: Of course, the ideal way to conduct this experiment would be with four pairs of identical Sheldons and Amys. One pair that was neither dating nor living together. One pair that was dating but not living together. One pair that was living together but not dating. And then, of course, one pair that was living together and dating. Although, with that many Sheldons, it\u2019d be such a party, we\u2019d never get anything done.", "Penny: That was a cute story. So, um, what did you want to ask me?", "Sheldon: Well, you\u2019ve lived with your significant other for some time. I would like this experiment to go well. Are there any insights you can share?", "Penny: Mm. Well, the biggie is, if she has an insane roommate, kick him out as soon as possible.", "Sheldon: You know, Leonard and I were very happy before you came along.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Amy: You\u2019ve been roommates with Sheldon forever. Do you have any advice?", "Leonard: I\u2019m trying to think of an answer that won\u2019t stop you from doing this. ", "Cutting between Penny\u2019s apartment and Leonard and Sheldon\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: I know it sounds like a clich\u00e9, but compromise is key. ", "Leonard: Never leave a belt on the floor. At night, they look like snakes.", "Penny: Do little things, like bring her a cup of coffee in bed.", "Leonard: Keep M&M\u2019S in your pocket in case you have to wait in a long line.", "Penny: You\u2019re gonna be seeing each other a lot, so respect each other\u2019s personal space.", "Leonard: He startles easily, so, please, no flash photography.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: How many pairs of underwear did you pack for the move?", "Amy: I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t count.", "Sheldon: You truly are the Goofus to my Gallant.", "Amy: That\u2019s me. Listen, you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that?", "Sheldon: Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions I feel in line at Space Mountain.", "Amy: Well, if you\u2019re nervous about the sleeping arrangements, maybe we should talk about it.", "Sheldon: Okay. Talk.", "Amy: Well, I imagine one of your concerns might be coital expectations. ", "Sheldon: Wow, no foreplay or anything, just right to it. ", "Amy: Look, I know this experiment is a big step outside of your comfort zone. So why don\u2019t we take being physical off the table and maybe later on, once we\u2019re more settled in, we can revisit it.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re really okay with that?", "Amy: I\u2019ve never lived with someone, either. This is a lot for me, too.", "Sheldon: This is such a relief. Honestly, if it didn\u2019t get you all worked up, I\u2019d kiss you right now.", "Amy: Good call. Seeing your Teen Titans underwear really got my motor running.", "Sheldon: I know. They probably shouldn\u2019t sell those to children.", "Scene: The hallway.", "Penny: Well, here\u2019s your key.", "Amy: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Enjoy having the place to yourselves.", "Leonard: You enjoy your mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s Penny\u2019s bedroom. Plenty of men have gone before.", "Penny: Now, now, there\u2019s no need to make this emotional.", "Amy: Shall we?", "Sheldon: I guess this is it.", "Leonard: You guys have fun.", "Sheldon: You, too. Oh, don\u2019t forget. Tuesday the air filters need to be changed.", "Penny: Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.", "Sheldon: Oh. Oh, and every other day, check the water level on the avocado pit.", "Leonard: I\u2019m on it. 15 years from now, we\u2019ll make guacamole together.", "Sheldon: Leonard, please, let me go.", "Amy: Come on, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Oh. Bye.", "Leonard: Good night.", "Penny: Good night.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s it. For the next five weeks, we are officially living together.", "Sheldon: I guess the experiment begins.", "Penny (off, screaming): Wa-how, we did it.", "Leonard (off, also screaming): Yeah.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: Which side of the bed would you prefer?", "Amy: Doesn\u2019t matter to me. Your choice.", "Sheldon: No, no, we\u2019re living together now, everything\u2019s equal. You know? I know that I have a tendency to be controlling, so I would rather you choose.", "Amy: Well, Sheldon, I really appreciate that, but these things mean more to you than they do to me, so whatever you want.", "Sheldon: Well, clearly, it\u2019s not whatever I want, because what I want is for you to make this decision, and you refuse to do that.", "Amy: Well, I\u2019m not refusing. I\u2019m just trying to be considerate.", "Sheldon: Like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom, and then watched me roll right into traffic?", "Amy: Sheldon, will you please just pick a side?", "Sheldon: Fine. Okay. Now, on this side, I am closer to the exit in case of emergency.", "Amy: Great. That\u2019s your side.", "Sheldon: No, but I\u2019m also closer to the entrance in case of attack.", "Amy: Okay, I\u2019ll take that side.", "Sheldon: Ah, then again, what are the odds of someone attacking me?", "Amy: Rising rapidly.", "Sheldon: Now, this side offers me proximity to the bathroom, but I am closer to the window where perverts can watch me sleep.", "Amy: Okay. What if we do this?", "Sheldon: I suppose that works.", "Amy: Great.", "Sheldon: Although now I\u2019m kind of worried someone\u2019s hiding behind those drapes.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom. ", "Bernadette: This is ridiculous. The doctor knows what the baby is, the ultrasound tech knows, Raj knows, his Grey\u2019s Anatomy online fan group probably knows. Is it weird we don\u2019t?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe the surprise will make it more fun. Like magic tricks. Remember how disappointed you were when I explained the never-ending hanky?", "Bernadette: I was disappointed to see the man I was engaged to pulling rainbow scarves out of his fly.", "Howard: But how delightful was it when I pulled out a bouquet at the end of those scarves? It\u2019ll be the same thing when the doctor pulls a beautiful surprise out of you.", "Bernadette: Everyone said I could do better.", "Howard: But you didn\u2019t listen, and presto change-o, my baby\u2019s inside you. Ta-da.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Amy (off): Ugh. What is that? (Entering) Why did you switch sides?", "Sheldon: Be grateful I\u2019m still in the room.", "Amy: Comfy?", "Sheldon: Oh, I\u2019m just happy I don\u2019t know what this memory foam remembers.", "Amy: Sheldon? I know we took coitus off the table, but I was wondering how you feel about other forms of intimacy, such as snuggling.", "Sheldon: Well, it\u2019s funny you should ask, because I was wondering how you\u2019d feel about separating the two of us with a pillow wall.", "Amy: Sheldon, I\u2019ve made more than enough accommodations for you. We\u2019re both grown adults, we\u2019ve been far more intimate than this. If you don\u2019t want to snuggle, fine, but we\u2019re not building a pillow wall.", "Sheldon: Okay, well, I am sorry. I\u2019m just worried that my sensitivity to temperature could make this a rough night. And no offence, but your bottom radiates enough heat, I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t iguanas lying on it.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: That\u2019s it. It\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s bedtime, he is in for the night.", "Penny: Wow. I cannot believe we are alone in our own apartment.", "Leonard: It\u2019s weird. This must be how parents feel when their kid goes off to college. Unless they feel sad, then it\u2019s different.", "Penny: So, what do you want to do?", "Leonard: I know exactly what we are gonna do.", "Penny: Really? You\u2019re a genius, and that\u2019s the first thing you come up with?", "Leonard: Hey, Sheldon\u2019s not here, so we are going to put on music and dance in our underwear.", "Penny: Ugh. Can we just have sex?", "Leonard: Oh, don\u2019t worry. Once you see my sweet moves, sex is inevitable.", "Penny: Inevitable, you say?", "Leonard: I\u2019ll just let my hips do the talkin\u2019.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: Screw it. I\u2019m calling and finding out.", "Bernadette: Good. Call him. Wait, I\u2019m not sure I want to know.", "Howard: But you just said you wanted to know.", "Bernadette: Well, now I don\u2019t know if I want to know!", "Raj: Hello?", "Howard: Call you back.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: No, Dr. Feynman. If I solve it for you, you\u2019ll never learn.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Wow, where did you learn these moves?", "Leonard: The world may have forgotten about Dance Dance Revolution, but not this smooth criminal.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: Okay, you\u2019re positive you want to know?", "Bernadette: Yes.", "Howard: Okay. Here we go. It\u2019s ringing.", "Raj: Hello?", "Bernadette: Wait.", "Howard: Wrong number.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: I told you not to do the worm.", "Leonard: You were right. ", "Scene: Raj\u2019s bedroom. Phone rings.", "Raj: Hello.", "Bernadette (off): I changed my mind, hang up, hang up.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Amy: Oh, oh, oh.", "Sheldon: What are you doing down there?", "Amy: Hang on.", "Sheldon: Who are you calling? Aaargh!", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Amy: I\u2019m so sore. I don\u2019t think I slept two minutes last night.", "Penny: Yeah, get it, girl.", "Amy: It\u2019s not what you think.", "Leonard: I feel like I pulled something. Why didn\u2019t you tell me to stop?", "Penny: Even more not what you think.", "Amy: I don\u2019t know if I can make it through five weeks living with him.", "Leonard: If you ever need a break, the owner of the train store will let you leave him there while you get a coffee.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Good morning. See? I didn\u2019t knock, but it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t knock, but it\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t knock, but it\u2019s fine. So, how is everyone?", "Amy: Miserable and exhausted.", "Sheldon: Really? I slept great.", "Amy: Well, I didn\u2019t, and it\u2019s your fault.", "Sheldon: How? You had the whole floor to yourself.", "Amy: Sheldon, maybe living together is a bad idea.", "Sheldon: Well, but what kind of scientists would we be, drawing a conclusion after only 12 hours of data?", "Amy: The kind who almost put a pillow over your face last night.", "Sheldon: Wow. I anticipated we\u2019d have problems, but I never thought your scientific rigour would be one of them.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry, are you questioning my integrity as a scientist?", "Sheldon: If the lab room disposable shoe cover fits.", "Penny: Was that a science diss?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Penny: Was it a good one?", "Leonard: Eh.", "Penny: Oh.", "Amy: What would a theoretical physicist understand about an experiment anyway? I mean, you wouldn\u2019t know a confounding variable if two of them hit you in the face at the same time. And you don\u2019t even get that joke, \u2019cause you don\u2019t even work with confounding variables.", "Sheldon: How dare you?", "Amy: Oh, you heard me. Your experimental bona fides are laughable.", "Sheldon: Whoa, whoa! Now you\u2019re making fun of my bona fides?", "Amy: Can\u2019t make fun of something that\u2019s a null set.", "Penny: I feel like I should say damn.", "Leonard: Do it.", "Penny: Damn. ", "Sheldon: Well, if you are so protective of the scientific method, perhaps we should use the next five weeks to finish what we started.", "Amy: Well, for science, maybe I will.", "Sheldon: For science, maybe you should.", "Amy: Fine.", "Sheldon: Fine.", "Amy: Good.", "Sheldon: Great.", "Amy: Do you want to go to our place and make out?", "Sheldon: Does Stephen Hawking roll through the quad?", "Penny: The new neighbours are weird."]}
