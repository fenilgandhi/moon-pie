Okay.", "Raj: How bad is it?", "Sheldon: Let me put it this way, do you own a barrel and suspenders?", "Raj: Are you serious?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not wearing this visor to play women\u2019s golf.", "Penny: Hi.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Oh, let me guess. You guys are drafting your fantasy accounting firms.", "Leonard: We\u2019re helping Raj figure out his finances.", "Penny: Well, he has a job. How bad can it be?", "Sheldon: Well, his rent and car lease are exceedingly high. You couple that with his penchant for dining out and shopping.", "Penny: Wait, wait, not shopping for clothes, right? Because look.", "Sheldon: He also has a remarkable amount of credit card debt.", "Howard: I thought your dad paid your cards.", "Raj: I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.", "Sheldon: What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?", "Raj: That\u2019s a penguin I sponsor. They\u2019re losing their homes to global warming, and my car gets, like, seven miles a gallon, so I felt bad.", "Leonard: What is Pink Cheeks?", "Raj: It\u2019s intimate waxing. Quit looking at that.", "Leonard: Maybe you should find someone to help you get your finances under control.", "Raj: Like a business manager?", "Sheldon: No, absolutely not. You can\u2019t afford to hire someone who\u2019ll forbid you from spending your money on foolish expenses. That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.", "Howard: What if there\u2019s someone who just likes controlling other people and stealing joy from their lives?", "Sheldon: He sounds like a sociopath.", "Leonard: We don\u2019t know, his mother never had him tested.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re talking about me. Very funny. Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget and forcing Raj to adhere to it without an ounce of compassion.", "Penny: Wait, wait, who\u2019s gonna break it to the penguin?", "Raj: Okay, Sheldon. Yeah, I\u2019m putting you in charge of my finances. I will not spend another penny that you don\u2019t authorize.", "Sheldon: Very well. Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday. You can\u2019t buy one.", "Howard: Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Amy: You\u2019re actually going to Comic-Con?", "Penny: Well, Leonard wants me to do more stuff like that with him, so I thought maybe this year I\u2019d tag along.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s sweet. I bet you\u2019ll have fun.", "Penny: So, do you want to come?", "Amy: No, thanks. I already live in a place all the nerds come to.", "Penny: Please? I went to your boring thing last month.", "Amy: My aunt\u2019s funeral?", "Penny: Come on, even you checked your e-mail during the eulogy.", "Amy: Well, I\u2019m not going, but I do think it\u2019s nice you want to.", "Penny: It\u2019s not that I want to go, I just think it\u2019ll make Leonard happy. And if I have to watch him squeeze into an Ewok costume, so be it.", "Amy: Look at you, going to Comic-Con, talking about Ewoks. I really have become the cool one around here.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Howard: You actually think Penny will have fun at Comic-Con?", "Leonard: No. Which will make me miserable, which is usually Sheldon\u2019s job.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s gonna hate waiting in line for the panels.", "Howard: And hate all the crowds at the panels.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s gonna hate the panels.", "Leonard: She\u2019s gonna hate how often we say the word panels.", "Howard: Why don\u2019t you just tell her not to come?", "Leonard: Well, she\u2019s so excited, I can\u2019t do that to her.", "Howard: What if you make it sound so bad she won\u2019t want to go?", "Leonard: That I would do to her.", "Raj: I can\u2019t believe Penny\u2019s gonna get to go, and I\u2019m not.", "Sheldon: You can always watch the panels online. Oh, boy, we do say that a lot.", "Stuart: Panels. Just wanted to be included.", "Raj; Come on, Sheldon, it\u2019s Comic-Con. Just let me have the money for this, and I won\u2019t ask for anything else.", "Sheldon: You put me in charge of your finances. If you wanted someone weak and spineless you could walk all over, you should have asked Leonard.", "Leonard: See? Miserable.", "Raj: Okay, you\u2019re right, I got myself into this, but I\u2019ve never missed a Comic-Con with you guys.", "Sheldon: Your father may have spoiled you, but I won\u2019t. If you want a ticket to Comic-Con, I suggest you figure out a way to earn the money yourself.", "Howard: Yeah, you\u2019re a grown man who\u2019s highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you.", "Raj: Go ahead, make jokes. I don\u2019t know why you think you\u2019re going to Comic-Con, you just had a baby.", "Howard: So?", "Raj: Well, so? So you think Bernadette\u2019s just gonna let you jet down to San Diego for five days and leave her alone?", "Leonard: Hang, hang on. So I have to bring Penny, you can\u2019t afford it, Howard\u2019s gonna get in trouble, and this guy gets to have a great time.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m gonna go as Dumbledore.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Howard: Mm-mm, how\u2019s my favourite girl?", "Bernadette: Okay.", "Howard: What you doing?", "Bernadette: Making lasagna.", "Howard: Oh, she\u2019s sexy, she can cook. I\u2019m such a lucky guy.", "Bernadette: You want something stupid, or you did something stupid?", "Howard: No. I just walked in here, saw how beautiful you are and had to tell you.", "Bernadette: Oh, dear God, you\u2019re cheating on me with Raj. ", "Howard: Ha ha ha, never gets old. Okay, there is something I want, but it\u2019s not a big deal.", "Bernadette: What is it?", "Howard: Well, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday, and I was hoping I could go with the guys. But before you say anything, I\u2019ll make up for being gone by doing everything around here, I mean everything. I\u2019m even gonna answer for you. Yes, Howard, you can go. ", "Bernadette: It\u2019s so hard to say no to you.", "Howard: Thank you.", "Bernadette: So I\u2019ll say maybe.", "Howard: What? Why? ", "Bernadette: You said tickets don\u2019t go on sale till Friday, right?", "Howard: Yeah.", "Bernadette: You said you were gonna do all this stuff for me, right?", "Howard: Yeah.", "Bernadette: See where I\u2019m going with this?", "Howard: Yeah.", "Bernadette: If you don\u2019t know how to make lasagna, Google does.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Okay, so this is the main Comic-Con floor. It\u2019s where all the vendors and exhibits are.", "Penny: Wow, that is a lot of people jammed in there.", "Leonard: I know. Sometimes Howard wears a striped shirt so we can play Where\u2019s Wolowitz? Okay, now, This is us camping out in line for the Avengers panel.", "Penny: Oh, you really sleep on the sidewalk, huh?", "Leonard: Yeah. It can get chilly, but Raj figured out that if you pee in a bottle and put it in your sleeping bag, it helps keep you warm. Here\u2019s the hotel room we all share. ", "Penny: Well, you and I would get our own room, right?", "Leonard: Every hotel is booked. But, yeah, see this space here between Sheldon\u2019s feet and my head? That\u2019s where you go.", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s no different than when Sheldon used to climb in bed with us during a thunderstorm.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t be doing much sleeping anyway. It\u2019s like an all-night party. There\u2019s trivia contests and Dungeons & Dragons. As we like to say, it\u2019s off the chain mail.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Leonard: I even said off the chain mail, and she still wants to go.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s probably my fault. She may have heard about my cool Dumbledore costume.", "Stuart: Okay, I can give you 20 bucks for the whole box.", "Raj: But you charged me hundreds for this stuff.", "Stuart: I know. And I did it with a straight face.", "Raj: But I need to earn enough money so I can go to Comic-Con.", "Stuart: Well, all right. I\u2019ll give you 25 bucks. That\u2019s my best offer.", "Raj: I have no choice.", "Stuart: You know, if you want to make extra money, I could throw some work your way.", "Raj: Really? I\u2019ll do anything.", "Stuart: Great, you\u2019re hired. First thing you can do is put price tags on these. Start the little ones at fifty.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car. ", "Penny: You know, it\u2019s no big deal. I can put up with anything for three days.", "Amy: Comic-Con\u2019s five days.", "Penny: Are you kidding me?", "Amy: Why don\u2019t you just tell him you don\u2019t want to go?", "Penny: I can\u2019t, it\u2019ll break his heart. You know, he\u2019s always making an effort to do things with me he doesn\u2019t enjoy, like going outside.", "Amy: He is an indoor cat.", "Penny: You know, maybe it won\u2019t be that bad. Leonard says it\u2019s really mainstream now. Comic books aren\u2019t just for sad nerds any more. I mean, it is still a key part of their demographic.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house. Raj rings the doorbell.", "Bernadette (off): Howie, can you get that?", "Howard (off): Kind of busy.", "Bernadette (off): Busy like I\u2019ll be with the baby if you go to San Diego?", "Howard: Hey.", "Raj: What\u2019s with the gloves?", "Howard: They complete my ensemble. What do you want?", "Raj: I\u2019m looking to make extra money and was wondering if you had any chores I could do.", "Howard: Hang on. Bernie, can I outsource my chores to an Indian guy?", "Bernadette: No.", "Howard: I tried.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Hey, I was thinking, if you want to do a couples costume, we could paint ourselves green and be Hulk and She-Hulk. Or we could paint ourselves blue and go as Nightcrawler and Mystique.", "Penny: Is there any scenario where we\u2019re not in full body paint?", "Leonard: Yeah, if you want us to look like losers.", "Penny: Hey, um, are you sure the guys are okay with me coming?", "Leonard: Yeah, of course, why?", "Penny: This is just something you usually do together, and if I\u2019m screwing it up, I don\u2019t have to go.", "Leonard: Oh, why? Do you not want to go?", "Penny: Why? Do you not want me to go?", "Leonard: No, I want you to go.", "Penny: Okay, good, \u2019cause that\u2019s what I want, too.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: Now we\u2019re going as Hulk and She-Hulk. I don\u2019t want to take my shirt off at Comic-Con.", "Sheldon: If I may speak for Comic-Con, we don\u2019t want that either.", "Leonard: Is that nice?", "Sheldon: No, but it\u2019s honest, and it sounds like you could use a little more honesty in your relationship.", "Leonard: Uh, it\u2019s more complicated than that.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m always honest with Amy. The other day she said she was self-conscious about the beauty mark on her shoulder, and I said, you know, you can call that a beauty mark all you want. When there\u2019s hair growing out of it, that\u2019s a mole.", "Leonard: Do you think she\u2019s as honest with you?", "Sheldon: I should hope so. When she called me an insensitive jerk, I\u2019d like to think she meant it.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Howard: There\u2019s got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.", "Raj: Yeah, you\u2019d think. Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.", "Bernadette: I really should wear a bell around my neck so you guys can hear me coming.", "Raj: Here, let me help you.", "Bernadette: Thank you.", "Raj: Oh, Double Stuffed Oreos, I remember when I could afford you.", "Bernadette: There she goes.", "Raj: Stay, I\u2019ll get her.", "Bernadette: I appreciate it.", "Raj: That\u2019s fine. She and I can cry together.", "Bernadette: He\u2019s such a sweetie. ", "Howard: I know, I wish there was some way we could help him.", "Bernadette: If he could find a girl with a job, all his problems would be over.", "Howard: Yeah, that\u2019s working out great for me.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: Penny says they\u2019re ready to go.", "Sheldon: Very well. Prepare for a long night of deceit.", "Amy: Sheldon, women can wear make up, it\u2019s not lying.", "Sheldon: I was talking about Leonard. And if make up is so truthful, why is it called concealer?", "Amy: Wait, wait, wait, what\u2019s Leonard lying about?", "Sheldon: He doesn\u2019t really want Penny to go to Comic-Con. He\u2019s just doing it to make her happy.", "Amy: Really? Because she doesn\u2019t actually want to go. She\u2019s just doing it to make him happy.", "Sheldon: So they\u2019re both trying to make each other happy, and the end result is they make each other sad? That\u2019s hilarious. I can\u2019t wait to tell them.", "Amy: No, you\u2019re not gonna tell them anything. You\u2019re gonna stay out of it.", "Sheldon: Why?", "Amy: Because it\u2019s between them. ", "Sheldon: Well, if you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019ve been between them for the last ten years.", "Penny: Hey.", "Amy: Hi. ", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: Hey, babe, you want to drive?", "Leonard: Sure, or you can.", "Penny: No, it\u2019s fine, I know you don\u2019t like the way I drive.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t have a problem with your driving.", "Sheldon: Are you listening to this? They deceive each other about everything.", "Amy: Shh.", "Penny: Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.", "Leonard: He wasn\u2019t in a car, but okay.", "Penny: Just say you want to drive.", "Leonard: I honestly don\u2019t.", "Penny: Amy, do us a favour, please drive.", "Amy: Sure, happy to.", "Leonard: If you want to drive, just drive. I don\u2019t see why this has to be so complicated.", "Penny: It\u2019s not complicated. Amy\u2019s driving, that\u2019s it.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not it because you\u2019re clearly upset.", "Penny: You\u2019re the one who seems upset.", "Leonard: Why would I be upset?", "Amy: Because you don\u2019t want her to go to Comic-Con.", "Sheldon: This is an interesting way to stay out of it.", "Penny: Wait, you don\u2019t want me to go?", "Leonard: Well, I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna have a good time.", "Sheldon: Yeah, well, get this, neither does Penny, that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t want to go. You set \u2019em up, I knock \u2019em down, good job.", "Leonard: Why would you say you wanted to go if you didn\u2019t?", "Penny: I just thought it would make you happy.", "Leonard: O-o-o-okay, hold on, so if you don\u2019t want to go and I don\u2019t need to bring you, is everything good?", "Penny: Hold on, I\u2019m trying to decide if I\u2019m mad at you. No, I\u2019m happy I don\u2019t have to go.", "Leonard: All right, problem solved.", "Penny: Okay.", "Sheldon: Not entirely, the fight over who\u2019s going to drive is still\u2026", "Amy: Oh, my God, stop talking.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s house.", "Amy: The place looks great. Did you guys get a maid?", "Bernadette: Kinda. ", "Howard: Dinner\u2019s almost ready. If you like meatloaf, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll like its cousin, bowl of meat.", "Penny: Hey, if you\u2019re still looking to make money, I will pay you to burn that jacket.", "Raj: Thank you, but it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019m going to Comic-Con this year.", "Sheldon: Well, with as much debt as you have, probably not next year either.", "Bernadette: Howie?", "Howard: Sure. This is for you.", "Raj: What\u2019s this?", "Bernadette: It\u2019s back pay for all the babysitting and taking care of Halley you\u2019ve done.", "Howard: There\u2019s more than enough in there to cover Comic-Con.", "Stuart: Um, I also take care of Halley.", "Bernadette: And you live here for free.", "Stuart: I do, ma\u2019am, thank you, ma\u2019am.", "Raj: This is so generous of you, I, um, I don\u2019t know what to say.", "Leonard: Now you can come with us.", "Penny: Yeah, there\u2019s room in the bed by Sheldon\u2019s feet.", "Raj: As much as I appreciate this, I can\u2019t accept it, okay? Halley\u2019s my goddaughter, I don\u2019t take care of her for money.", "Stuart: I would.", "Bernadette: Keep it. Consider it a gift.", "Sheldon: Hold on. Is it back pay or is it a gift?", "Bernadette: What\u2019s the difference?", "Sheldon: When the IRS questions us in separate rooms, we need to have our stories straight.", "Raj: It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not keeping this. I\u2019m trying to pay my own way and be responsible. Taking handouts won\u2019t help that.", "Amy: So you\u2019re not going to Comic-Con?", "Raj: I\u2019ve been plenty of times. If I miss one, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m a big boy.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m a big boy, and if I missed one, I\u2019d throw a big-boy tantrum.", "Leonard: You know what? I\u2019ve gone 12 times. Maybe I\u2019ll sit out this year, too.", "Penny: Really?", "Leonard: Yeah. Maybe you and I can do something fun that weekend.", "Penny: Ooh, how about white-water rafting?", "Leonard: Oh, how about we compromise and go on the Small World ride at Disneyland?", "Howard: You know what, I\u2019m not gonna go either. I\u2019m a father now. I\u2019d rather spend time with my family.", "Bernadette: You just don\u2019t want to go alone with Sheldon.", "Howard: I\u2019m gonna go check on dinner.", "Amy: Sounds like everyone\u2019s staying home. What do you say?", "Sheldon: Nuts to that, I\u2019m going to Comic-Con.", "Amy: By yourself?", "Sheldon: Not necessarily. I have four months to find some new friends.", "Stuart: I\u2019ll go with you.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s very kind of you, Stuart. Check back in with me in July.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: There\u2019s my pretty girlfriend.", "Amy: I\u2019m not going with you to Comic-Con.", "Sheldon: What? Can\u2019t a man just be happy to see his woman and pat her on her second most erogenous ball-and-socket joint?", "Amy: He can, but it\u2019s still not changing my mind.", "Sheldon: Well, maybe what\u2019s in my pants will change your mind. It\u2019s a list of this year\u2019s panelists. It\u2019s long, isn\u2019t it?"]}
