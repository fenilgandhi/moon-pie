Leonard?", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: You realize you and I could become brothers.", "Leonard: We\u2019re not gonna be brothers. We\u2019re not gonna be stepbrothers. Go to sleep.", "Sheldon: I hope you\u2019re right. \u2018Cause a grown man living with his brother and his brother\u2019s wife is weird.", "Leonard: Go to sleep.", "Sheldon: Okay. Do you think your father\u2019s doing unspeakable things to my mother?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Are you saying that because the things are unspeakable?", "Penny: Your parents are old. Anything unspeakable was finished by 9:30. Go to sleep.", "Sheldon: Very well.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry if this stuff is gonna make the ceremony awkward.", "Penny: God, I thought my brother fresh out of jail was gonna make everyone uncomfortable, but now this.", "Sheldon: Hey, if you want me to sleep you\u2019re gonna have to stop talking.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m gonna go pick up my family. Like an hour and half, two hours, depending on traffic.", "Leonard: Yeah, drive safe. ", "Penny: Oh, hey, and do yourself a favour, all right? When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you\u2019re concerned, you don\u2019t know anything, you didn\u2019t see anything. I want you just to play dumb.", "Sheldon: It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example.", "Penny: What? Oh. Hi. Okay, hey there, I got, I\u2019m sorry, I got to go now.", "Beverley: Penny, wait.", "Penny: Why?", "Beverley: I wanted to thank you for going through all the trouble of planning a second wedding ceremony for me, but unfortunately I cannot attend.", "Leonard: Well, why? What\u2019s wrong?", "Sheldon: Whuh, are we still doing the dumb thing? Okay, why, what\u2019s wrong?", "Beverley: I just cannot stay here while your father goes out of his way to humiliate me.", "Sheldon: Oh, golly, however did he humiliate you?", "Beverley: Stop it, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Do I say stop what, or just throw in the towel?", "Beverley: I don\u2019t see why I should have to watch your father parade around with some bible-thumping bumpkin.", "Sheldon: Oh, excuse me, that is my mother you\u2019re talking about, however accurately.", "Penny: Okay, Beverley, aren\u2019t you overreacting a little? All we know is they shared a cab and had a nightcap. ", "Sheldon: And turned their phones off.", "Leonard: Not helping, buddy. Mother, Penny and I really want you to be part of this. Please stay.", "Penny: Yeah, plus if you leave, Alfred will know he got under your skin.", "Beverley: Well, we can\u2019t have that.", "Sheldon: You know, also, if they did have coitus, we\u2019ll all be needing a skilled psychiatrist.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Raj: It is funny when you think about it.", "Howard: Maybe to you. You didn\u2019t get a $500 traffic ticket.", "Bernadette: Because you were driving like a lunatic.", "Howard: Hey, if thinking secret government agents are chasing you makes you a lunatic, then, yeah, okay.", "Raj (doorbell rings): Oh, I\u2019ll get it.", "Bernadette: It didn\u2019t help that you couldn\u2019t walk a straight line when the cop pulled you over.", "Howard: I have performance anxiety. You of all people should know that.", "Raj: Hello.", "Air Force Officer: I\u2019m looking for Howard Wolowitz.", "Raj: Howard Wolowitz?", "Air Force Officer: I have the right address, don\u2019t I?", "Raj: Address?", "Air Force Officer: Is he here?", "Raj: Um, no. ", "Air Force Officer: Do you know where I can find him?", "Raj: May I ask what this is about?", "Air Force Officer: No, you may not.", "Raj: Very well.", "Air Force Officer: Have him call me.", "Raj: Okay.", "Howard (off): Raj, who\u2019s at the door?", "Raj: That\u2019s not him.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car. ", "Penny: Oh, I can\u2019t wait for you to meet everyone. I told them all about you.", "Susan (Penny\u2019s mother): Like what? Do they know about your brother?", "Penny: Uh, not everything, just, like, the jail and drugs part.", "Susan: Why would you do that?", "Penny: What?", "Susan: The world doesn\u2019t need to know our problems.", "Penny: Well, Mom, I\u2019m sorry, but\u2026", "Wyatt (Penny\u2019s father): Hey, look, they got Walgreens here, too.", "Susan: You really think it\u2019s helpful to change the subject, Wyatt?", "Wyatt: Just trying to make this a happy trip, dear.", "Susan: Well, quit it.", "Penny: So, uh, Randall, can\u2019t believe after all these years you finally get to visit me in California.", "Randall (Penny\u2019s brother): Well, good thing I was a non-violent offender, otherwise I couldn\u2019t have left the state.", "Susan: All right, that\u2019s enough jail talk.", "Randall: Penny knows where I was, she sent me cigarettes.", "Susan: You sent your brother cigarettes?", "Wyatt: He was cooking and selling crystal meth, Susan, I think we can let the cigarettes slide.", "Susan: Stop trying to be the cool dad, you have a shirt with our cat\u2019s picture on it.", "Wyatt: Anyway, we\u2019re here, slugger.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Howard: That\u2019s great, now they know where I live.", "Raj: What are you talking about? They\u2019ve always known where you live.", "Bernadette: Yeah, if you want to go off the grid, you have to move out of your mother\u2019s house.", "Raj: Can we take a moment to discuss that I just lied to the government for you?", "Howard: Yeah. I would not have done that for you.", "Bernadette: Howard, please just call the man, see what he wants.", "Howard: All right, all right.", "Raj: Hey, make sure you tell him that you weren\u2019t home when he came by and that your Indian friend gave you the message the moment you stepped through the door.", "Howard: Yes, hello. Uh, this is Howard Wolowitz for Colonel Richard Williams.", "Raj: Oh, I take it back, don\u2019t mention me.", "Howard: Hi, Colonel Williams, how can I help you? What? Oh, uh, yes, he is from India. No, I don\u2019t know his immigration status. Relax, I\u2019m still on hold. Speaking. Okay, sure, I can meet with you on Thursday. Caltech is fine. Yeah, and may I ask what this is about? I may not?", "Raj: That\u2019s what he said to me.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Here you are, Mother.", "Beverley: Thank you.", "Leonard: I\u2019m glad you decided to stay. It\u2019s gonna be special for Penny and me to share this with you.", "Beverley: I can\u2019t wait for this day to be over.", "Leonard: Yeah, special, like that. (Knock on door) That\u2019s them. Please don\u2019t make things any more awkward than they already are.", "Sheldon: All right, so less or equally awkward, got it.", "Leonard: Hey, guys, come on in.", "Alfred: Oh, thank you.", "Mary: Good morning.", "Beverley: Morning.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Alfred: How is everyone today?", "Beverley: Good, and you?", "Alfred: Good, good.", "Beverley: Good.", "Mary: I\u2019m good, too.", "Beverley: Good.", "Sheldon: So, did you defile my mother or not?", "Mary: Sheldon. You\u2019re being rude.", "Alfred: If I may, I can assure you, your mother and I did nothing more than share a cab and a conversation.", "Sheldon: Did that conversation include the phrase your genitals are a joy to behold?", "Mary: That\u2019s enough.", "Alfred: Look, I promise you, neither I, nor anyone, has ever said that.", "Leonard: You don\u2019t know his girlfriend very well.", "Sheldon: Or what a joy it is to behold my genitals.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: All right, you guys, uh, get settled in, then we\u2019ll go across the hall and say hi to everyone.", "Randall: You know, It\u2019s hard to believe I\u2019ve never met Leonard.", "Wyatt: Well, he probably buys his illegal drugs from a local vendor.", "Susan: Not funny, Wyatt.", "Penny: I thought it was really funny.", "Wyatt: Thanks.", "Susan: Well, fine, if everyone wants to make jokes about our problems, then I can, too. Knock, knock. Who\u2019s there? Our family is an embarrassment.", "Randall: That\u2019s not much of a joke.", "Penny: Okay. Listen, Mom, I know you\u2019re nervous, but I promise you, no one is gonna judge you or this family.", "Susan: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just we\u2019re meeting Leonard\u2019s parents for the first time, and, and they\u2019re academics and, and intellectuals, and I don\u2019t want them thinking we\u2019re white trash.", "Randall: Well, what colour trash do you think they\u2019ll believe?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Mary: How could you think that I would spend the night with a man I just met?", "Sheldon: A man named Jesus convinced you to build a church in Africa. You\u2019re kind of a sucker.", "Leonard: Well, nothing happened, right? It\u2019s over. Until we get married a third time, you guys will never have to see each other again.", "Alfred: Well, you know, actually that\u2019s not the case. Mary may visit me in New York.", "Mary: Mm-hmm. And he\u2019s never been to Texas.", "Alfred: Maybe we meet halfway.", "Sheldon: What? In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia? I can\u2019t be the only one that knows that\u2019s halfway.", "Beverley: You\u2019re not seriously going to visit each other.", "Alfred: And why wouldn\u2019t we?", "Beverley: Oh please, you\u2019re just saying this to antagonize me.", "Alfred: Oh, not at all. Mary happens to be a wonderful woman. And if it antagonizes you, that\u2019s just a bonus.", "Leonard: Mary, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in the middle of this.", "Mary: No, no, nothing to be sorry about. I genuinely like your father.", "Sheldon: What? But he\u2019s a mediocre academic. And according to Beverley, his sexual prowess is sub-par. He\u2019s basically Leonard with a bigger prostate.", "Leonard: Are you saying that my dad\u2019s not good enough for your mom?", "Sheldon: Yes, while also getting in a solid dig at you. Pretty efficient, huh?", "Leonard: This is ridiculous. I\u2019m going across the hall.", "Sheldon: But why should you get to go and leave me here with your bickering parents?", "Leonard: Fine, then you go.", "Mary: Well, I don\u2019t want to stay here with her. I\u2019ll go.", "Alfred: I\u2019ll go with you.", "Leonard: That still leaves me here with him.", "Sheldon: Hang on, hang on. We\u2019re smart, we can figure this out. Okay, so: Mary and Beverley can\u2019t be together. Uh, Alfred and Beverley can\u2019t be together. Leonard and I can\u2019t be together. Now, I could be with Alfred but I don\u2019t like his face. Oh, here. I\u2019ve got it.", "Amy: Who\u2019s ready for a wedding?", "Sheldon: Great, now I have to start all over.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Wyatt: So how\u2019s the world of pharmaceuticals treating you?", "Penny: Pretty good. I actually just got assigned a much better territory.", "Susan: See what happens when you work hard?", "Randall: Hey, she just sells drugs. I had to make \u2019em.", "Susan: Okay, that\u2019s enough. No more drug talk for the rest of this trip.", "Wyatt: I\u2019ll drink to that.", "Susan: Haven\u2019t you had enough?", "Wyatt: Penny drinks more than I do.", "Penny: Well, I learned from the best.", "Wyatt: Aw.", "Penny: Aw.", "Susan: Very nice, Wyatt. And you wonder why this one turned out the way he did.", "Randall: You see what I\u2019ve gotta put up with.", "Susan: What you\u2019ve gotta put up with? Why did you have to go to jail?", "Randall: It\u2019s called getting caught, Mother.", "Leonard: Hello.", "Wyatt: Hey, there he is.", "Penny: Hey.", "Susan: Oh, Leonard. It\u2019s so nice to see you again.", "Leonard: Oh, you, too. Hey, everyone, this is my mother, Beverley.", "Beverley: Hello.", "Susan: Hi.", "Randall: We are not white trash.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: Are you excited to see your son walk down the aisle?", "Alfred: Yes, I am. I\u2019m just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I\u2019ve caused.", "Mary: Oh, so am I.", "Sheldon: You made God sad today, Mom.", "Amy: Sheldon, they haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I think it\u2019s nice they\u2019re hitting it off.", "Sheldon: Well, that\u2019s still no reason to rush into anything. I mean, look at us. We took things remarkably slow. You and I, we didn\u2019t even hold hands for two years.", "Amy: It was a lot hotter than it sounds.", "Alfred: You\u2019re a patient young lady.", "Sheldon: Hey, hey. She\u2019s mine, take a cold shower, grandpa.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Howard: Why wouldn\u2019t that colonel say what the meeting\u2019s about? It has to be bad news.", "Raj: Calm down, okay? Try not to think about it.", "Howard: That\u2019s really stupid advice.", "Raj: You know that hurts my feelings.", "Howard: Calm down, try not to think about it.", "Raj: Okay. ", "Howard: Why do I bother talking to you?", "Raj: Oh, come on. What\u2019s the worst that could come of this meeting?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know. They take the invention away, and I get nothing?", "Raj: Okay, that\u2019s not so bad. You know what happened to the scientists that worked on the Manhattan Project? The government forced them to move to the desert. They had to live in secret, and when Oppenheimer objected to what they made him do, they destroyed his reputation.", "Howard: What\u2019s the point of that story?", "Raj: I just read a book about Oppenheimer, seemed like a chance to show off. (Howard laughs) There he is, there\u2019s my happy Hebraic homeboy. Yeah, that\u2019s the smile I\u2019m gonna remember when you\u2019re living in the desert and I\u2019m living with your wife.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Beverley: So, what do you do for a living?", "Randall: Mommy, you want to take this one?", "Susan: Um, Randall\u2019s in between jobs. ", "Randall: And court appearances.", "Wyatt: It\u2019s nice to meet the woman who raised this fine young man. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting his father.", "Beverley: Prepare to be disappointed.", "Leonard: And he can\u2019t wait to meet you, too. Can I get anyone a drink?", "Wyatt: Well, I could use another beer. ", "Susan: You\u2019re done. He\u2019s done.", "Penny: Hey. Is everyone getting to know each other?", "Randall: Not at all.", "Scene: The wedding ceremony. ", "Stuart: Nice to see you again, Dr. Hofstadter. I\u2019m, uh, Leonard\u2019s friend, Stuart.", "Beverley: Nice to see you, too.", "Stuart: Hi, I\u2019m Stuart.", "Alfred: Oh, I\u2019m Alfred. Leonard\u2019s father.", "Stuart: Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, I\u2019m sorry, did you two want to sit together?", "Together: No.", "Stuart: I was wondering why the front row was available.", "Bernadette: Okay, I think we\u2019re ready.", "Sheldon: Why do people cry at weddings?", "Mary: They\u2019re practicing for what\u2019s coming later.", "Susan: Thank you for cleaning yourself up for your sister\u2019s wedding.", "Randall: Thank you for my new teeth.", "Wyatt: Welcome to the family, Leonard. Don\u2019t lend your new brother-in-law money.", "Bernadette: We\u2019re here today to celebrate love.", "Beverley: Urgh.", "Alfred: Sigh louder, no one heard you.", "Stuart: Really, I can move.", "Bernadette: Not just Leonard and Penny\u2019s love, but the love we have for them, as well as each other.", "Sheldon: Speaking of love, STDs among the elderly are skyrocketing.", "Bernadette: Love is patient, but it\u2019s not gonna put up with all the side chatter, so let\u2019s knock it off.", "Howard: At least she\u2019s yelling at someone else for a change.", "Bernadette: Howard.", "Penny: Okay, I understand everyone\u2019s a little tense today, so I am just gonna get to the important stuff. Leonard, standing here with you in front of our family and friends is bringing up a lot of feelings. Like what a good idea it was to elope the first time. But also how incredibly happy you make me. Thank you for marrying me. Hopefully for the last time.", "Leonard: Penny, as a scientist, my job is to figure out why things happen. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand how someone like me could get to be with someone like you. You know, maybe I don\u2019t", "need to understand it, I just need to be grateful. I love you, Penny.", "Penny: Oh.", "Bernadette: Anybody have anything snarky to say about that? Didn\u2019t think so.", "Alfred: I\u2019d like to say something. Beverly, I know that we don\u2019t bring out the best in each other. ", "But something wonderful did come from our relationship. That young man right there.", "Beverley: I couldn\u2019t agree more.", "Stuart: That\u2019s beautiful.", "Bernadette: Thank you. All right, let\u2019s continue.", "Sheldon: Yeah, excuse me, I need to say something to someone pretty special, and I just can\u2019t wait any longer.", "Amy: It\u2019s happening.", "Sheldon: Leonard, you and I have our ups and downs. But I have always considered you my family. Even before the recent threat of our parents fornicating like wrinkly old rabbits. I don\u2019t always show it, but you are of great importance to me. Both of you. ", "Penny: Oh.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Bernadette: Okay. I now pronounce you husband and wife. And weird other husband who came with the apartment.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Beverley: Thank you for taking us to the airport.", "Leonard: Hey, I\u2019m just thrilled we\u2019re all getting along for a minute.", "Alfred: Yeah, me, too. Beverly, I\u2019m sorry if I upset you.", "Beverley: Water under the bridge, Alfred. Leonard, why don\u2019t you get into the carpool lane?", "Alfred: Well, that\u2019s a solid line. He can\u2019t cross that.", "Leonard: That\u2019s okay. I can make it over.", "Beverley: No, no, let\u2019s plod along. It\u2019ll make your father feel more comfortable.", "Alfred: What makes me comfortable is knowing I don\u2019t have to wake up tomorrow morning and see your sour face.", "Beverley: Do the world a favour, and don\u2019t wake up tomorrow morning.", "Leonard: That was almost a minute.", "Scene: Amy\u2019s car.", "Mary: There\u2019s a lot of traffic. Are we gonna be okay?", "Amy: You\u2019ll be at the airport an hour before your flight.", "Mary: Good. Thank you.", "Sheldon: Plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy.", "Mary: Hey. I will not have you be disrespectful to me.", "Sheldon: Yes ma\u2019am.", "Amy: Sheldon, you\u2019re mother\u2019s an attractive woman. You need to get use to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.", "Sheldon: Well, and you need to drive the car and mind your business.", "Amy: I will not have you be disrespectful to me.", "Sheldon: What, you\u2019re not my mother.", "Mary: Don\u2019t you be disrespectful to her.", "Sheldon: Yes ma\u2019am.", "Mary: You\u2019ll get there. You\u2019ve just gotta put some zing on it.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Susan: Penny, I don\u2019t know what I was worried about. You\u2019re friends are just lovely.", "Penny: Oh, thanks, Mom.", "Susan: Although that Sheldon is a bit peculiar.", "Penny: Is he? I never noticed.", "Wyatt: He reminds me of that turkey we had who drowned looking up at the rain.", "Randall: Cops, cops, be cool."]}
