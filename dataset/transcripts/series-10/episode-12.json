You know how Sheldon is if he sees Christmas stuff lying around after New Year\u2019s.", "Penny: Yeah, but he doesn\u2019t live here anymore.", "Leonard: Well, he doesn\u2019t live at Walmart, but he still threw a tantrum when he saw Marshmallow Peeps after Easter. And that\u2019s the same man who complains you can\u2019t find Marshmallow Peeps after Easter.", "Penny (checking phone): Oh. It\u2019s Bernadette. She says they\u2019re running late. The baby threw up on Howard, and then Howard threw up on Howard.", "Leonard: Well, he didn\u2019t throw up on the baby. That\u2019s a win.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Amy: Hi.", "Penny: Hi. Welcome back. How was Texas?", "Sheldon: Oh, you know., the lone star state. Hmm. That should be its Yelp rating.", "Amy: It was not a great trip.", "Penny: Well, you\u2019re home now.", "Sheldon: Yeah. It is good to be home. Oh, good lord, is that mistletoe? Don\u2019t you maniacs own a calendar?", "Penny: I told him to take it down. He would not listen to me.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Did you at least have a good flight down there?", "Sheldon: It was fine. Other than the weird-tasting juice Amy gave me, I slept the whole way.", "Penny: So, what happened in Texas that was so bad? ", "Leonard: And before our next drive to Comic-Con, I need the name of that juice.", "Sheldon: Well, we were on our way to my mother\u2019s house\u2026", "Flashback.", "Sheldon: How did we get in the car?", "Back to apartment.", "Leonard: Hold on. How did you get him in the car?", "Amy: I rented one of those carts, pushed him toward the open door and just let inertia take care of the rest.", "Flashback.", "Amy: So, while we\u2019re at your mother\u2019s house, it might be a good time to tell her that we\u2019re living together.", "Sheldon: Do we have to? I really don\u2019t want to hear the religious lecture.", "Amy: Maybe there won\u2019t be one.", "Sheldon: There\u2019s always one. She gave it to my sister about her boyfriend, my brother about his girlfriend, my father about his girlfriend. That one had some un-Christian words in it.", "Amy: Well, she likes me. You know, there\u2019s a chance she might be okay with it.", "Sheldon: Eh, I don\u2019t know. I am her precious little boy. And you did take my flower.", "Back to apartment.", "Penny: Do boys have flowers?", "Leonard: Who knows what he has down there.", "Penny: Mm.", "Sheldon: Anyway\u2026", "Flashback.", "Mary: Thank you, God, for the food we are about to receive and for the nourishment of our bodies and bless the hands that prepared it. Amen.", "Sheldon: Given that your hands prepared it, isn\u2019t that a little self-serving?", "Mary: You start changing the words to the prayers, next thing you know, you\u2019re in a church with a guitar.", "Amy: Thank you for cooking, it looks delicious.", "Mary: Oh, it\u2019s my pleasure. Mm. I\u2019m so glad y\u2019all could make it. So, tell me, what\u2019s going on back home?", "Amy: Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.", "Mary: Oh, that\u2019s wonderful. Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?", "Sheldon: Welcome to Texas.", "Amy: They haven\u2019t said. Anyway, we, uh, we also have some exciting news to share.", "Sheldon: Oh, wait, wait, shouldn\u2019t we just eat? You know, I mean, God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joes.", "Mary: Come on, Shelly, tell me your news.", "Sheldon: All right. This is on you. Amy and I are living together in sin, like a couple of New Yorkers. Now, while you scold us, I\u2019m going to get a knife and a fork. Joe may be sloppy, but Sheldon\u2019s not.", "Mary: Well, thank you for letting me know, and I, for one, am thrilled.", "Sheldon: What? Wh, where\u2019s the judgment? Wh, where\u2019s the fire and brimstone? Where\u2019s the part where you tell us we\u2019re going to Hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside? We\u2019re already there.", "Mary: Obviously, I would prefer if you weren\u2019t living out of wedlock, but given your special circumstances, I\u2019m very happy for you.", "Sheldon: And what special circumstances are those?", "Back to apartment. ", "Penny: Oh, boy, I think it\u2019s about to get bad.", "Flashback.", "Mary: Shelly, how do I put this? By your third birthday, you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains, and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them.", "Sheldon: What, so you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life?", "Mary: No. Just for the middle part. \u2018Cause at the end I assumed there\u2019d be nurses.", "Sheldon: Well, this is highly insulting.", "Amy: Sheldon, don\u2019t overreact.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m the child she was worried about? I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn\u2019t power a potato clock, if I spotted them the potato.", "Amy: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.", "Mary: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.", "Back to apartment. ", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Well, I was in my room, I couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying.", "Amy: I\u2019ll take over from here.", "Flashback.", "Amy: He\u2019s been in there a long time. Should I go talk to him?", "Mary: He\u2019s upset with me. I should be the one who talks to him.", "Amy: Are you going to?", "Mary: Oh, heck no.", "Amy: Sheldon, what, what are you doing?", "Sheldon: Just being the unsocialised eccentric my mother always thought I was.", "Mary: You startin\u2019 to see why I didn\u2019t go in there? Sheldon, if you\u2019re trying to prove me wrong, the tighty-whities on your head ain\u2019t changing my mind.", "Amy: We\u2019re ignoring the fins, okay.", "Sheldon: Yeah. And I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re taking her side. By being my girlfriend, she\u2019s saying you\u2019re a weirdo, too.", "Amy: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she\u2019s saying.", "Back to apartment.", "Sheldon: And?", "Amy: That\u2019s exactly what she was saying.", "Sheldon: Can you believe my mother thinks we\u2019re both strange?", "Leonard: Absolutely not.", "Penny: That\u2019s too loud.", "Leonard: Absolutely not.", "Amy: Well, after that, Sheldon and I got out of the house for a while.", "Sheldon: Well, first we buttered my feet to get the swim fins off, and then we went out.", "Flashback. ", "Amy: You know, I\u2019m sorry your mother made you feel bad. But, you know, at the end of the day, she was wrong, because you\u2019re not alone.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right. I have Leonard and Howard and Raj, Stuart, Penny, Leonard\u2019s mom, Bernadette, Wil Wheaton\u2026", "Amy: What about the woman who just buttered your big flat feet?", "Sheldon: I was going chronologically. You\u2019re right between Koothrappali\u2019s father and Omar, the one-eyed Sparkletts guy.", "Amy: Well, let\u2019s try to not let it ruin the rest of our trip.", "Sheldon: I knew we should\u2019ve never mentioned us living together in the first place.", "Amy: She was gonna find out eventually.", "Sheldon: Disagree. We\u2019ve known about evolution since 1859, she still believes in Noah and his amazing zoo boat. This could have all been avoided if you\u2019d only listened to me.", "Amy: Sheldon, I knew your mother was fine with us living together because I already told her we were.", "Sheldon: Why would you do that?", "Amy: This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.", "Sheldon: You managed the situation?", "Amy: That\u2019s right. ", "Sheldon: So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I\u2019m incapable of running my own life.", "Amy: Not your whole life. I mean, science, you got that. Organizing your sock drawer, you\u2019re the king. But understanding how other people are feeling, that\u2019s a weak spot for you.", "Sheldon: I have gotten much better at that.", "Amy: Have you? How am I feeling right now?", "Sheldon: What? How should I know? Excited? Itchy? Give me the first letter. ", "Amy: You and I are in a relationship. I help you with your shortcomings, and you help me with mine.", "Sheldon: How would you feel if I contacted your mother behind your back?", "Amy: Delighted that you showed any interest in my family at all?", "Sheldon: Delighted? What., not if I guessed for a hundred years.", "Back to apartment.", "Bernadette: Hi.", "Howard: Hey, guys.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Penny: Hi. There\u2019s the little family!", "Raj: Hello.", "Stuart: Hello.", "Leonard: And their Sherpas.", "Penny: Mm.", "Howard: The baby\u2019s asleep, can we put her in your room?", "Penny: Yeah. Go ahead.", "Amy: Do you need help?", "Howard: No. I got it. Doubtfire, Poppins, follow me.", "Bernadette: Sorry we\u2019re late.", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s no problem, Amy and Sheldon were just telling us about their trip to Texas.", "Sheldon: Yeah. Here. I\u2019ll catch you up.", "Flashback.", "Sheldon: How did we get in the car?", "Back to apartment.", "Penny: Stop. Okay. They told Mary they were living together, there was a fight, he got his feelings hurt, then he put underwear on his head.", "Leonard: On purpose, not the way it used to happen in high school.", "Sheldon: I was acting odd intentionally.", "Bernadette: Really? So you can control it?", "Penny: Okay. Then what happened?", "Sheldon: Well, there\u2019s really not much left to tell. I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) My mother made me take it out. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) Amy put alcohol on it. (Flashback to Sheldon screaming.) And here we are.", "Howard: What did we miss?", "Bernadette: I couldn\u2019t explain it if I tried.", "Scene: The same, later. ", "Penny: So tell me, how did Sheldon look with an earring?", "Amy: Like the pirate who helps the other pirates connect to the Internet.", "Howard: So what did you and Leonard do?", "Penny: Actually, we got in a pretty nasty fight.", "Leonard: It might\u2019ve been the worst one we\u2019ve ever had.", "Raj: Oh, my God, what happened?", "Leonard: Well, we had started binge-watching Luke Cage together, and it was kind of our thing, and then I find out that she watched two episodes without me. ", "Bernadette: It\u2019s like I was excited for a present and got socks.", "Stuart: I don\u2019t understand how that turns into the worst fight of your life.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with socks.", "Penny: To be fair, we may have been on edge because of the Christmas tree.", "Howard: What happened ", "Flashback.", "Penny: You do make a cute elf.", "Leonard: Oh, yeah? And you thought Spock ears were only good for Comic-Con.", "Penny: Hey, hey, I just found a farm where they let you chop down your own tree.", "Leonard: Oh cool, I\u2019ll be like a pointy-eared Paul Bunyan.", "Time lapse.", "Leonard: Stupid idea.", "Penny: No, what\u2019s stupid is a physicist who doesn\u2019t understand when you swing an axe, you don\u2019t let go.", "Leonard: For the tenth time, my mittens were slippery!", "Penny: Ugh. It\u2019s 70 degrees, you didn\u2019t need mittens.", "Leonard: You know how easily I blister.", "Penny: Yes, yes, you bruise, you peel. It\u2019s like I\u2019m married to an old piece of fruit.", "Leonard: Look, we could keep fighting and let it ruin our night, or, or we can stop and try to salvage the evening.", "Penny: Fine.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Penny: Leonard?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Penny: There\u2019s something on the windshield.", "Flash forward to the stairwell.", "Penny: You need a break?", "Leonard: Do not need a break.", "Penny: There\u2019s no shame in asking for a break.", "Leonard: If I need a break, I\u2019ll ask for a break.", "Flash forward.", "Penny: Ugh. Leonard?", "Leonard: Yeah?", "Penny: There\u2019s a tree on you.", "Flash forward. ", "Leonard: You want to decorate it tonight?", "Penny: Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.", "Leonard (hearing animal noises): I hope it kills us both.", "Back to apartment.", "Leonard: By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.", "Sheldon: So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it?", "Bernadette: Sure.", "Sheldon: Hey, how\u2019s life with your baby?", "Amy: Really? You\u2019re never gonna touch their baby?", "Sheldon: To this day I\u2019ve never touched Stuart.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s been wonderful, Sheldon, thanks for asking.", "Flashback. ", "Bernadette: Oh, please stop crying, I\u2019m begging you. I don\u2019t know what else to do. My boobs are empty. Do you want lasagna? Shh, shh, shh, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay. Shh. What have we done?", "Howard: Hey, I found superhero baby wipes, the perfect way to clean up crime, and tushies.", "Bernadette: It took me two hours to get her down.", "Raj: You know, in India when my baby brother cried like that, the servants would just take him far away so we couldn\u2019t hear it. Not always, sometimes we\u2019d leave.", "Howard: Hey, he got her to stop.", "Bernadette: That was so fast.", "Raj: Oh, he\u2019s really good with her.", "Bernadette: Yeah, he has a gift.", "Howard: What\u2019s the matter?", "Bernadette: Nothing, these are happy tears.", "Howard: Oh, good.", "Bernadette: No they\u2019re not, you bozo. How come Stuart can get her to stop crying, but I can\u2019t?", "Howard: I mean, it\u2019s Stuart. Maybe she\u2019s playing possum until he goes away.", "Bernadette: Not funny.", "Raj: She\u2019s tired, that was funny.", "Bernadette: Everyone\u2019s a better mom than me.", "Raj: Oh, don\u2019t take it so personally, maybe your baby\u2019s just a jerk.", "Back to apartment.", "Sheldon: Wait, so how does the story end? Is the baby a jerk or is Bernadette a bad mother?", "Amy: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: What? Is there another twist coming? Is the baby not theirs at all?", "Leonard: Ignore him. How did you get the baby to stop crying?", "Stuart: Oh, I just talked to her. I\u2019ve been told the sound of my voice puts people to sleep.", "Penny: You poor things you must be exhausted.", "Howard: It has been hard to sleep with all the crying.", "Flashback. ", "Bernadette: How can she hate me? I make her food in my chest. It\u2019s like hating a frozen yogurt machine.", "Howard: She doesn\u2019t hate you, stop saying that.", "Bernadette: Now you hate me too.", "Howard: Shh, I don\u2019t hate you. ", "Back to apartment. ", "Sheldon: It says here that up to 80% of new mothers experience baby blues. And that the best thing to do is reassure them that they\u2019re doing a good job. Bernadette, you are doing a good job.", "Bernadette: Thank you, Sheldon, I\u2019m feeling better now.", "Sheldon: Thank you, Internet. I\u2019m telling you, with the right YouTube video, I can give Howard a vasectomy.", "Penny: So things started to turn around?", "Bernadette: Yeah, eventually I figured out how to get the baby to sleep.", "Leonard: Please tell me you didn\u2019t use Amy\u2019s magic juice.", "Flashback. ", "Howard: Bernie?", "Bernadette: Shh. She\u2019s asleep.", "Howard: Great. And where are you?", "Bernadette: Down here.", "Howard: Oh. This is new.", "Bernadette: I didn\u2019t know what else to do. It worked.", "Howard: Well, I\u2019d say that\u2019s thinking outside the box, but, come on.", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t make me laugh.", "Howard: Do you need help getting out?", "Bernadette: I think I live here now. It\u2019s fine.", "Howard: Is it okay if I get some sleep?", "Bernadette: Yeah, go ahead.", "Howard: Good job, Mommy. I\u2019m proud of you.", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t make me cry, either.", "Howard: Good night. I love both my girls.", "Bernadette: We love you, too.", "Back to apartment.", "Penny: I can\u2019t believe you fit in the crib.", "Bernadette: I could take a bath in the sink. I don\u2019t, but I can.", "Raj: So how were your holidays?", "Stuart: Oh, thank you for asking. Uh, I, uh, went to visit my grandmother. She\u2019s in Bakersfield. Uh, usually my brother and sister go\u2026 oh come on.", "Scene: The same, later. ", "Amy: That was fun, thank you.", "Bernadette: Yeah, thanks.", "Penny: Our pleasure.", "Leonard: See you guys at work.", "Raj: Be there bright and early.", "Howard: Not me, paternity leave.", "Sheldon: Oh. A small human wreaks havoc on his wife\u2019s genitals and he gets time off.", "Howard: With pay, sucka. Forgot the baby, still new to this."]}
