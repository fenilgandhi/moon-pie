I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.", "Amy: And I\u2019m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.", "Sheldon: And welcome to a special retrospective, where we will take a look back at the history of Fun with Flags on an episode we\u2019re calling\u2026", "Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Flags: A Retrospective.", "Howard (singing): Wondering how it all began?", "Raj (singing): You\u2019ll need a good attention span.", "Howard (singing): For information and entertainment.", "Raj (singing): That\u2019s equally effective.", "Together (singing): It\u2019s fun with flags, behind the flags, a retrospective. Flags.", "Sheldon: Mind you, when we say behind the flags, we don\u2019t literally mean these flags. That\u2019s just where we have dinner.", "Amy: Now, I\u2019m sure many of you are wondering how Fun with Flags began. ", "Sheldon: So let\u2019s hear from some people who were there at the very start. How, Howard, flashback sounds.", "Amy: Could have played that on my harp.", "Sheldon: Just roll the clip. (On voiceover) So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when Fun with Flags was born.", "Leonard: I honestly don\u2019t remember.", "Sheldon: Sure you do. I was telling you both the story about how Haiti and Lichtenstein discovered they had the same flag. It was at the Summer Olympics of 1936, and two plucky nations\u2026", "Penny: Oh, wait. I remember.", "Sheldon: Oh, and do you remember what you said?", "Penny: Yes. Please find someone who cares.", "Sheldon: And that\u2019s exactly what I did. I found a lot of someones. ", "Amy: Almost 200. Many of them on purpose.", "Sheldon: And now we\u2019re going to turn it over to you, the viewers, to call in and share your favourite Fun with Flags moments. ", "Amy: And don\u2019t get discouraged if the phone lines are jammed. Just keep trying. (Long pause) Oh, thank God, welcome to Fun with Flags.", "Bert: Hey, Sheldon. Hey, Amy. It\u2019s Bert.", "Sheldon: Hello, Bert. What is your flag-related comment or query?", "Bert: I have a girlfriend. ", "Amy: And what does that have to do with flags?", "Bert: Nothing. I just wanted everyone to know I have a girlfriend.", "Sheldon: Bert, you\u2019re tying up the line. My apologies to all of you trying to call in with legitimate flag comments.", "Amy: Ooh, ooh. All right. We have our next caller.", "Bert: Her name\u2019s Rebecca.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s van. ", "Howard: Should we get lunch or you want to eat at the zoo? Oh, Howie, I don\u2019t need food as long as I can look at my phone.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t like when you imitate me.", "Howard: You want to hear my Stuart? It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve gone on a date. You mind if we watch the monkeys doing it?", "Stuart: I said that to you in confidence.", "Howard: This is supposed to be our family fun day. What\u2019s so important on your phone?", "Bernadette: I\u2019m on the day care\u2019s website.", "Howard: Stop looking at that. The day care\u2019s great. It\u2019s on campus. My office is two minutes away. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.", "Bernadette: What if she likes the people who work there more than us?", "Howard: She already likes soap bubbles more than us.", "Bernadette: When I go back to work, we\u2019re gonna leave her with these people. We don\u2019t know anything about them.", "Howard: They\u2019re highly-trained educators with background checks. They\u2019re even required to be current on all vaccinations.", "Stuart: You leave her with me, and I\u2019m not any of those things.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Sheldon: Where\u2019s Howard?", "Raj: He took the day off.", "Sheldon: Oh, let\u2019s take advantage of his absence and tell the kinds of jokes only physicists get. I\u2019ll go first. Okay, here. Uh, Heisenberg is pulled over by a police officer. And the policeman says, did you know you were going 85 miles per hour? And Heisenberg says, darn it, now I don\u2019t know where I am.", "Leonard: So Howard back Monday?", "Raj: Yeah.", "Bert: Hey, guys.", "Sheldon: Oh, hello.", "Leonard: Hey. Want to join us?", "Sheldon: Ah-ah-ah, he\u2019s a geologist, and I have more physics jokes.", "Raj: Oh, quick, sit.", "Leonard: So, Sheldon says you have a new girlfriend.", "Sheldon: Yeah, which he rudely announced on my flag show. People were so upset about it no one else called in the rest of the night.", "Bert: Sorry. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I guess I just love love.", "Raj: Well, I\u2019m very happy for you.", "Leonard: Hey, we\u2019re all having dinner tonight. Why don\u2019t the two of you join us?", "Sheldon: Hold on. We don\u2019t know anything about this woman. ", "Bert: What do you want to know?", "Sheldon: Is she a geologist?", "Bert: No. ", "Sheldon: Oh great, see you at seven. ", "Scene: The Zoo.", "Howard: How about after this we go see the exotic bird show?", "Stuart: Not a good idea. My hair is a coveted nesting material.", "Howard: Learning anything?", "Bernadette: Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers\u2019 bodies for almost a year. I\u2019m going back to work after only four months, so I\u2019ve learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.", "Howard: Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.", "Bernadette: It\u2019s not just the sloth. Polar bears nurse their cubs for almost eight months. The orangutan mother builds her baby a new home every night. And what do I do? I choose my career over my child.", "Stuart: Told you we should have gone to Legoland.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Can\u2019t believe Bert has a girlfriend and I don\u2019t.", "Amy: I thought you were taking a break from women to focus on your career.", "Raj: Oh, grow up.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t you have any friends he can date?", "Penny: Hey, I already set up Howard and Bernadette. It\u2019s your turn to ruin some poor girl\u2019s life.", "Raj: Oh, hey, guys. Come in.", "Bert: Thanks. Everyone, this is Rebecca.", "Rebecca: Hi.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s younger and far more attractive than he is. They\u2019re copying you two.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Howard: What are you making?", "Stuart: Chicken. Birds mess with my hair, I come back hard.", "Howard: Finally get Halley down?", "Bernadette: Yeah, eventually. She\u2019s still not happy about taking a bottle, though.", "Howard: Look, if you\u2019re not ready to go back to work, we\u2019ll figure something out.", "Bernadette: No, I\u2019ll be fine. ", "Stuart: It might be good for her. Howard\u2019s mother was around him all the time, and he\u2019s a world-class mama\u2019s boy.", "Howard: I mean, why would you say that?", "Stuart: Go ahead, have a tantrum, that\u2019ll prove me wrong.", "Bernadette: It would be nice to raise Halley to be a little more independent than you were.", "Howard: I guess. It wasn\u2019t until college that I learned you can put a thermometer in your mouth.", "Stuart: On that charming note, dinner is served.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: So is this your first time dating a scientist? \u2018Cause I\u2019m thinking of starting a support group.", "Rebecca: Actually, I\u2019m not new to this. I was engaged to a Scientologist.", "Sheldon: Bert, Rebecca. I\u2019d like to apologize for my insensitive comment earlier.", "Rebecca: Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s fine.", "Sheldon: See? It was fine. I didn\u2019t need a time-out.", "Amy: It wasn\u2019t a time-out. Let\u2019s get some food.", "Sheldon: You made me sit on the stairs and think about what I did.", "Amy: Get your food.", "Raj: So how did you two meet?", "Rebecca: Oh, it\u2019s such a cute story. We met on a dating Web site.", "Leonard: Is that it?", "Rebecca: Oh, sorry. The end.", "Raj: That\u2019s nice. I haven\u2019t had much success meeting people online.", "Bert: I didn\u2019t either, until I revamped my profile.", "Sheldon: What\u2019d you do, delete your photo?", "Amy: Go.", "Sheldon: Fine.", "Amy: And don\u2019t you slam that door.", "Sheldon: Aw, man.", "Rebecca: Did I say something wrong?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s always him.", "Penny: , Bert, you were telling us how you updated your profile?", "Bert: Right. I wasn\u2019t getting any responses, and then I added recent $625,000 MacArthur grant winner, and five minutes later I met my soul mate.", "Amy: I was wrong. You can come back in.", "Leonard: So, Rebecca, how did you become a personal trainer?", "Rebecca: I came to Los Angeles to be an actress, and things didn\u2019t really work out.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d say she\u2019s copying you again, but I\u2019m getting tired of sitting in the hall.", "Raj: I\u2019d love a personal trainer. I haven\u2019t seen my abs since they opened a Shake Shack on my drive home.", "Rebecca: I could give you some free sessions.", "Penny: Oh, is that offer for everybody?", "Leonard: Nice try. I\u2019m not going.", "Rebecca: Where\u2019s your bathroom?", "Leonard: Mm, just down there.", "Bert: She\u2019s so perfect, sometimes I think she isn\u2019t real. And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.", "Penny: Aw, that\u2019s so weird.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry, Bert, but aren\u2019t you worried she\u2019s only with you for your money?", "Bert: She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.", "Sheldon: Your first date? Did you even measure her walls?", "Penny: You know, on our first date, Leonard used a coupon to buy me a pretzel.", "Leonard: And we lived happily ever after. ", "Penny: The end.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Bernadette: Well, guess I\u2019m ready to go.", "Howard: Have a great first day back.", "Bernadette: You have everything she needs for day care?", "Stuart: Yep, all in the bag.", "Bernadette: Okay. Okay, sweetie, Mommy\u2019s gonna go to work now, so you have fun today.", "Howard: I told her if day care is anything like prison, find the biggest baby and knock him out.", "Stuart: Bye, cutie. I\u2019m gonna miss you. I\u2019m gonna be waiting right here tonight when you get home.", "Bernadette: Stop, you\u2019re gonna make me cry.", "Howard: Great, now everybody\u2019s crying.", "Stuart: At least Halley\u2019s not.", "Howard: That\u2019s good.", "Bernadette: She\u2019s not gonna see us all day, and she doesn\u2019t even care.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Sheldon: Who\u2019s ready to laugh?", "Leonard: O-o-o-o-oh.", "Sheldon: Okay. So, Feynman, Einstein and Schrodinger walk into a bar. Feynman says, it appears", "we\u2019re inside a joke. Einstein replies, but only to an observer who saw us walk in simultaneously. To which Schrodinger says, if someone\u2019s looking in the window, I\u2019m leaving.", "Leonard: That\u2019s actually funny.", "Raj: You should send that to Jimmy Fallon.", "Bert: Hey.", "Leonard: Oh, hello. Join us.", "Raj: Hey. Yeah. Hey, sorry if last night was awkward.", "Bert: Actually, it got me thinking that I shouldn\u2019t flaunt my money to find love. I might break up with Rebecca.", "Leonard: Wow, that\u2019s a big step.", "Raj: I think it shows a lot of character.", "Bert: I\u2019m gonna hold out and see if I can find a hot young blonde who likes me for me.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s a good one. Okay, now, Leonard, you tell a joke.", "Scene: The daycare. ", "Bernadette (on phone): How\u2019s she doing?", "Howard: She\u2019s great. Look.", "Bernadette: I see a wall, floor, some Asian baby, there she is.", "Howard: See? Nothing to worry about.", "Bernadette: Thank you. Okay, I\u2019m gonna try and get some work done.", "Howard: Yeah, me, too. Love you.", "Bernadette: Love you, too. Bye.", "Stuart: How is she?", "Howard: What are you doing here?", "Stuart: Can\u2019t a guy hang out at a college he doesn\u2019t go to and stare at a baby that isn\u2019t his?", "Howard: I get it. I haven\u2019t even made it to my office yet.", "Stuart: Is it weird if we just stand here and watch her all day?", "Howard: Probably. We should go.", "Stuart: Yeah. Or we could take her to the aquarium.", "Howard: I\u2019ll get her, you grab her bag. ", "Stuart: Hang on, Halley, we\u2019re busting you out of there.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Amy: What are you looking at?", "Sheldon: Comments from our Behind the Flags retrospective. Get this, people are calling it the longest one yet.", "Bert: Hello? Anybody home?", "Leonard: Is that Bert?", "Bert: It\u2019s Bert.", "Penny: I think it\u2019s Bert.", "Raj: Hey, what\u2019s up?", "Bert: I broke up with Rebecca.", "Penny: Oh.", "Amy: Oh. You know, good for you.", "Bert: No, I miss her. I don\u2019t know why I listened to you.", "Sheldon: He\u2019s not wrong. It was your crackpot idea that he deserves love.", "Amy: You know, you need to start raising your hand before you speak. Yes, starting now.", "Penny: Bert, you\u2019re a good guy, you deserve a woman who\u2019s interested in more than just your money.", "Bert: She was also interested in walking around my house in her underwear. Now the only one doing that is me.", "Leonard: If you\u2019re that upset, go get her back.", "Bert: I tried. She\u2019s not answering my calls. Which really hurts because I bought her that phone. I made a huge mistake.", "Raj: No, you didn\u2019t. Okay? Look, Bert, when I had money, I dated lots of girls who weren\u2019t right for me. And then I gave up my money, and now I\u2019m alone and living with my friends, and somebody else should probably talk now.", "Penny: Look, sweetie, relationships aren\u2019t about money, okay? It\u2019s about respect and having things in common and\u2026 yes, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: You and Leonard don\u2019t have anything in common. Maybe you should break up.", "Leonard: You called on him.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen.", "Stuart: Guess who\u2019s home from day care?", "Howard: It\u2019s Halley. Unless somebody else put an X on the bottom of their kid\u2019s foot.", "Bernadette: You realize they called when you took her.", "Howard: Guess who\u2019s home from the aquarium?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Bert: Sorry again for barging in.", "Leonard: You don\u2019t have to go. You\u2019re welcome to hang with us.", "Sheldon: Actually, our friendship group is at capacity. But if anybody drops out, you\u2019re at the top of the list. Unless it\u2019s Raj, in which case, we\u2019ll probably get a person of colour.", "Bert: You guys are nice, but I\u2019m just gonna buy Rebecca a Jet Ski and see if that gets her back.", "Raj: I feel bad for Bert.", "Sheldon: So he\u2019s using his money to attract a mate. Is that any different than me using my intelligence to attract Amy? Or Leonard using his power of grovelling to get Penny?", "Leonard: It\u2019s totally different. Bert\u2019s money might run out, but I can beg until the end of time.", "Penny: All that and he\u2019s shorter than me.", "Raj: Sheldon, what did Amy have that attracted you?", "Sheldon: Oh, so many things. Her mind, her kindness, and especially her body.", "Raj: Really?", "Amy: Relax. We\u2019re the same blood type. He knew he could harvest an organ.", "Scene: The daycare. ", "Howard: She does look happy.", "Bernadette: See? This is the right thing for her. Let\u2019s all just go to work.", "Stuart: Any time.", "Bernadette: Let me just say good-bye. Halley. Look at Mommy. Over here, honey. Say good-bye to Mommy. Look at me. Look at your mother. All right, we can go.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Hello. I\u2019m Dr. Sheldon Cooper.", "Amy: And I\u2019m Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.", "Sheldon: Based on the glowing reception of our recent Behind the Flags retrospective, we thought you might like to see how it all came together. ", "Amy: So welcome to tonight\u2019s episode, ", "Together: Fun with Flags: Behind the Behind the Flags: A Retrospective Retrospective.", "Sheldon: Ooh, we already have our first call.", "Amy: Oh. Hello, you\u2019re on Fun with Flags.", "Bert: The Jet Ski worked. I got her back."]}
