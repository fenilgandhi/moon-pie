If it were an Olympic sport, I\u2019d complain about what a stupid sport it is and then I\u2019d take home the gold.", "Amy: Good stuff. So, uh, what about dinner?", "Sheldon: Is it me, or are you purposely changing the subject?", "Amy: No. And on the subject of subjects, is your use of the word subject the same or different as when we speak about the subject of a king?", "Sheldon: I have a feeling you\u2019re still doing it. But I find that topic irresistible, so, now, in ancient Mesopotamia, the king referred to the people as his property.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Howard: I\u2019m serious, JPL\u2019s actually developing a robot arm that could grab an asteroid before it hits us.", "Leonard: So their plan for saving the Earth from Armageddon is hoping a bunch of scientists can catch a ball?", "Raj: If we\u2019re all gonna die, why am I eating so much kale?", "Leonard: You\u2019re awful quiet, everything okay?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m concerned about Amy. She\u2019s acting a bit odd lately.", "Howard: Oh. Well, just out of curiosity, what registers as odd to you?", "Sheldon: Her behaviour. No, I have the feeling that she\u2019s hiding something.", "Leonard: I wouldn\u2019t worry about it. She\u2019s probably just distracted by work.", "Sheldon: Well, whatever it is, it\u2019s troubling me. And I can\u2019t eat, I can\u2019t sleep. And don\u2019t even ask about the consistency of my bowel movements.", "Howard: You heard him, guys, don\u2019t ask.", "Sheldon: Why would she keep something from me, you know?

Well, I feel both flattered and hurt. Like when people say I look like that skeleton from Nightmare Before Christmas.", "Raj: Oh my God, that\u2019s who you look like.", "Leonard: Sheldon, this is not a big deal. It\u2019s a little white lie, everyone does it.", "Raj: Not me, I\u2019m a hundred percent honest in all of my relationships.", "Howard: And how single are you right now?", "Raj: Eating cake on the toilet single. ", "Sheldon: Well, I won\u2019t tolerate deception in my relationship. I have no choice but to confront her.", "Howard: Don\u2019t do that, you\u2019ve got gold here.

That\u2019s terrible advice.", "Howard: So you wouldn\u2019t want to have anything on Penny?", "Leonard: Well, of course not.", "Howard: So, if I actually know something right now, and I do, you don\u2019t want me to tell you?", "Leonard: Uh, no. ", "Howard: I\u2019ll take that as a yes. She\u2019s secretly been moving your collectibles into storage a little at a time and you haven\u2019t noticed.", "Leonard: Are you kidding me?", "Howard: See, I\u2019ve known that for weeks, but, you know, I waited till the moment when it would cause him the most pain.", "Scene: Leonard and Penny\u2019s bedroom.

Why\u2019s it taking so long?", "Amy: Um, it was a drywall problem.", "Penny: Oh, no, what happened?", "Amy: Well, the drywall got wet, and you do not want wet drywall because when drywall gets wet, it\u2019s really more\u2026", "Penny: Wet wall?", "Amy: Or damp wall, just as bad.", "Penny: Mm. So why don\u2019t they just get more drywall?", "Amy: Well, they went to get some, but the woman at the wall store said it was going on sale and they should wait because the savings\u2026", "Penny: Okay, are you done? Bernadette told me your apartment\u2019s ready.", "Amy: I was done at wet wall, but you wouldn\u2019t let it go.", "Penny: But is Sheldon really believing all this crap?", "Amy: Well, he started to question it, but then I fake sneezed on him and he ran to take a shower. Please don\u2019t say anything, I feel terrible about this.", "Penny: Oh, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t.", "Amy: Thanks.", "Penny: The woman at the wall store?", "Amy: Let it go.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: Are you going to confront Penny?", "Leonard: Eventually, I guess. Although, I am kind of curious how long she thinks she can keep hiding my stuff without me knowing.", "Sheldon: Hmm. You know, perhaps instead of confronting them, we should see how far they\u2019re willing to spin their tangled webs. Like that Spider-Man action figure that used to be on your desk.", "Leonard: Oh, my God, I\u2019m going blind.", "Penny: Hi.", "Amy: Food\u2019s here.", "Sheldon: Excellent. I\u2019m very hungry.

That\u2019s enough. You know what? What is going on?", "Leonard: Fine, I told Sheldon that her apartment\u2019s been finished, but then you just said it\u2019s not, so now I\u2019m all confused.", "Amy: Penny was just covering for me. My place has been ready for two weeks.", "Sheldon: How could you lie to me?", "Penny: Uh, she\u2019s enjoyed living with you. It\u2019s called being in love.", "Leonard: Mm-hmm, and what\u2019s it called when you secretly get rid of all your husband\u2019s stuff?", "Penny: What?

Why did you tell Leonard I told you Penny was hiding his things?", "Howard: It just came up because we, we were talking about secrets and\u2026 wait, juH qachHom Dotlh Sov \u2018Iv (Who knows the status of Amy\u2019s apartment?)", "Amy: Everybody stop it with that.", "Raj: I\u2019m not really a part of this, so I\u2019m just gonna dig in.", "Amy: And I\u2019d like to know why you blabbed about my apartment.", "Howard: You\u2019re up, blabby.", "Bernadette: Amy, I\u2019m sorry, I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.", "Amy: I guess it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry that I lied about my apartment.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s all right.", "Leonard: And?", "Penny: And what? Your wizard robes are next to go.", "Raj: Now that everything\u2019s out on the table, you, you think you two will keep living together?", "Sheldon: Despite recent events, I do consider our experiment in cohabitation to have been positive.", "Amy: Are you saying you\u2019d like to live with me?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m open to the possibility.", "Penny: Ubamy bube cubool.", "Amy: Whatever.", "Howard: You know, if he moves across the hall for good, Leonard could keep the stuff you don\u2019t like in Sheldon\u2019s old room. Solves everything.", "Penny: That\u2019s a great idea.", "Leonard: Ooh, maybe I could turn it into a gaming den.", "Raj: That would be amazing.", "Sheldon: Wuh wuh hold on, excuse me, that\u2019s my room.", "Leonard: But you won\u2019t be living here.", "Sheldon: But that\u2019s my room.", "Leonard: But you won\u2019t be living here.", "Sheldon: But that\u2019s my room.", "Leonard: You guys might want to start eating. But you won\u2019t be living here.", "Penny: Sweetie, once you stop paying rent, none of this is really yours.", "Sheldon: But that\u2019s my room.", "Everyone: But you won\u2019t be living here.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s bedroom.", "Amy: Thank you for understanding.", "Sheldon: Hey, I get it. Everybody wants to spend more time with me. I\u2019m like a man made of sugar in a world of ants.", "Amy: Good night.", "Sheldon: Night. If we did continue living together, would it be here?", "Amy: I don\u2019t know. It, it could be. ", "Sheldon: Of course there\u2019s, there\u2019s always your apartment.", "Amy: Sure, sure, we, we could live in my apartment.", "Sheldon: I hate your apartment.", "Amy: Sorry, you brought it up?", "Sheldon: Well, I suppose we could find a whole new place. You know, and, technically, we don\u2019t even have to stay in Pasadena. We could, we could move to Altadena or a place that doesn\u2019t even end in dena.", "Amy: It\u2019s kind of exciting. I mean we could do whatever we want.", "Sheldon: But what if we move and we don\u2019t like it? What if there\u2019s a smoker in the building? Or pets? Or there could be mould? There could be traffic noise. I\u2019m gonna have to learn a whole new bus route. Are you trying to soothe me by singing the Star Trek theme as a lullaby?", "Amy: Yes.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not a child, don\u2019t do that.", "Amy: Sorry.", "Sheldon: Do you know 2001: A Space Odyssey? All right, now that\u2019s soothing.", "Scene: Leonard and Penny\u2019s bedroom", "Leonard: Look, I get it, this is still my room, we haven\u2019t really made it yours.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Leonard: Which is why I got you this Pink Power Ranger. Put it anywhere you like.", "Penny: Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.", "Leonard: I\u2019m kidding, I want you to feel at home here. Decorate it any way that makes you happy.", "Penny: Do you really mean that?", "Leonard: I really do.", "Penny: Great, and just so you know, I\u2019m not getting rid of all your stuff.", "Leonard: Yeah? What are you keeping?", "Penny: That candle and you.", "Leonard: What about my robot poster?", "Penny: Uhbubububuh, I can make do with just the candle.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s bedroom.", "Amy: What\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m struggling with the thought of leaving my old bedroom.", "Amy: Can it be more of an internal struggle?", "Sheldon: I need to see it. While I\u2019m gone, don\u2019t breathe on my pillow.", "Amy: How about if I just don\u2019t breathe at all?", "Sheldon: That\u2019s my girl. What on earth? What is going on?", "Leonard: Oh, hey, Sheldon.", "Penny: We turned your room into a sex dungeon.", "Sheldon (waking up in bed): No.", "Amy: What is happening?", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Howard: Okay, last question. The chaps he was wearing, assless?", "Sheldon: Can we just focus on the decision I\u2019m facing?", "Raj: We can, but for the record, all chaps are assless.", "Sheldon: Gentlemen, please, this is a significant decision. Now, do Amy and I continue living together? Or do I move back in with Leonard?", "Leonard: Over my assless chaps you will.", "Howard: This isn\u2019t complicated. Do you love Amy?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Raj: Do you like living with her?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Leonard: Do you know what you need to do now?", "Sheldon: Apparently, figure this out on my own \u2019cause you guys are no help at all.", "Scene: The stairwell. ", "Amy: Hi.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Amy: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m just contemplating Buridan\u2019s donkey.", "Amy: I understand. I\u2019ll leave you be.", "Sheldon: What, you\u2019re familiar with the reference?", "Amy: Of course. Jean Buridan proposed a philosophical thesis stating that a hungry donkey placed between two equidistant bales of hay would be paralysed by indecision and would starve to death.", "Sheldon: Exactly.", "Amy: Well, I wouldn\u2019t want you to starve to death, so here\u2019s an eggplant.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: You know, some people believe that Buridan was plagiarizing Aristotle.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Amy: Although, in Aristotle\u2019s example, he proposed an equally hungry and thirsty man caught between food and drink.", "Sheldon: Huh. Yeah, I wonder if that\u2019s related to the 12th century Persian philosopher, Al-Ghazali and his story of a man caught between two dates.", "Amy: Are you suggesting Al-Ghazali was Aristotelian? \u2018Cause if anything, he was anti-Aristotelian.", "Sheldon: Al-Ghazali was anti-Aristotelian? Boy, you think you know a guy.", "Scene: Leonard and Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Penny: Okay. Open your eyes and see your new room.", "Leonard: Wow.", "Penny: I know I went a little overboard. We can always dial it back.", "Leonard: No, no, no, no, no, it\u2019s, it\u2019s important to me that you have the bedroom you want.", "Penny: Oh, that means so much. I love you.", "Leonard: I love you, too.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Leonard: Just hiding some stuff in your closet, don\u2019t tell Penny."]}
