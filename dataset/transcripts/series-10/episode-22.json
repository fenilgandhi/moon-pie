", "Leonard: We\u2019re pinned down.", "Howard: We can\u2019t get through.", "Raj: Sheldon, get over here and help.", "Sheldon: Okay, one second.", "Leonard: Sheldon, why are you jumping up and down?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m trying to shoot.", "Howard: Then use the shoot button, not the wonderful thing about Tiggers button.", "Leonard: Aw.", "Raj: That\u2019s it, we\u2019re dead.", "Howard: Okay, challenge them again.", "Leonard: Doing it right now. Oh, they can\u2019t. There\u2019s an important Little League game tomorrow.", "Howard: No wonder they beat us, they\u2019re jocks.", "Sheldon: What happened to me? I used to excel at these things.", "Howard: Kids are always better at video games.", "Sheldon: Well, I don\u2019t like it.", "Leonard: Mm, if it makes you feel better, you still dress like a child.", "Sheldon: No, but it\u2019s not just video games. I downloaded the new O.S. for my phone, took me a week to stop accidentally texting kissy faces to everyone.", "Howard: Oh, so our love is not real?", "Raj: Well, I know how you feel. I tried one of those electronic Japanese toilets, practically shot myself across the room.", "Sheldon: I guess I just need to face it, I\u2019m no longer a wunderkind. Now I just wonder what\u2019s for lunch.", "Leonard: Hot dogs.", "Sheldon: Yay.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: A bar. ", "Penny: I didn\u2019t know you could drink while you\u2019re breastfeeding.", "Bernadette: Yeah, they say the yeast in beer helps with milk production.", "Amy: I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a myth, let me check.", "Bernadette: Ruin it for me and I\u2019ll break this glass over your head.", "Amy: To denial.", "Penny: Ooh. I\u2019m gonna get another. You want food?", "Bernadette: Yeah, breastfeeding burns, like, 5,000 calories a day. Do not touch that phone.", "Zack: Penny?", "Penny: Oh, Zack. Hey.", "Zack: What are the odds of running into you here?", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s a bar, so pretty good. Uh, what\u2019s new?", "Zack: Oh, tons of stuff. Put artificial grass in my backyard, got engaged, had a scary mole that turned out to be Sharpie.", "Penny: Well, congratulations.", "Zack: That\u2019s what my dermatologist said.", "Penny: No, on, on getting engaged, good for you.", "Zack: Oh, thanks. How about you? Hey, how\u2019s Leonard? Is he still smart?", "Penny: Yes, yes, he\u2019s working for the government on an infinite persistence gyroscope. Of course, the first time I say it right, he\u2019s not even here.", "Zack: I love that little guy. Hey, we should all have dinner sometime.", "Penny: Uh, yeah, sure, I\u2019ll check with Leonard.", "Zack: Cool, I\u2019ll check with Sara. Sara, pull up my calendar. It never works for me.", "Scene: The comic book store. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve been thinking about our recent humiliation.", "Leonard: You\u2019re gonna have to be more specific.", "Sheldon: At the hands of those teenagers.", "Leonard: More.", "Sheldon: Boy teenagers.", "Leonard: Oh, the video game. Yeah, that was bad.", "Sheldon: I started doing some reading on cognitive vitality, and I came across an area of research called super-aging.", "Raj: You know who\u2019s a super-ager? Jennifer Lopez. Like, what is her secret?", "Howard: Now, this is rare. I don\u2019t know which one of you I want to stop talking first.", "Sheldon: The theory is that if you really tax your brain, the neurofibers will become thicker and the glial cells more lustrous.", "Raj: Like J-Lo\u2019s hair.", "Howard: Boy, it is neck and neck right now.", "Leonard: How is super-aging any different than, like, doing crossword puzzles?", "Sheldon: Well, it\u2019s not just doing simple cognitive tasks. You need to push your brain out of its comfort zone and reach mental exhaustion.", "Leonard: I drive you to work every day, my brain must look like the Hulk.", "Raj: If you really want to challenge yourself, you could learn to speak Hindi.", "Sheldon: Jab mein aat saal ka tha maine seekha tha. (I did that when I was eight) ", "Raj: Could you say that in English? I actually, I never learned Hindi.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Hey, you ready to go?", "Leonard: Yeah, I guess.", "Penny: What\u2019s the matter?", "Leonard: Honestly? It\u2019s a little strange having dinner with your ex-boyfriend, and it\u2019s not like we have a lot to talk about.", "Penny: What? He loves you, okay? And he\u2019s interested in your work. You could talk about the infinite perspective\u2026 I swear I know it.", "Leonard: It\u2019ll be fine, let\u2019s just go.", "Penny: Well, and his fianc\u00e9e will be there, so you know, if the conversation lags, we can talk about their wedding.", "Leonard: Aaargh.", "Penny: Come on, I spent an entire plane ride with you talking about the trailer for Deadpool 2.", "Leonard: Ha, I knew you weren\u2019t asleep.", "Scene: A restaurant. ", "Zack: Hey, guys.", "Penny: Hi. Hey, where\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e?", "Zack: Oh, she couldn\u2019t make it. She had an emergency.", "Penny: Oh, no, what happened?", "Zack: I didn\u2019t ask.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hey.", "Raj: Hey.", "Amy: What smells so good?", "Sheldon: Raj is teaching me to make croissants.", "Amy: Is this part of your super-aging?", "Sheldon: Yes. Yeah, it seemed daunting at first, but then I realized, it\u2019s like the chemistry set I had as a kid. Only, when your brother eats this, no one has to call Poison Control.", "Raj: Okay. Shall we? Oh, my God. It\u2019s light, it\u2019s flaky, it\u2019s buttery. You don\u2019t need to have sex with him, just eat one of these.", "Sheldon: Yes, it is delicious. Physicist, baker, lover, what can\u2019t I do?", "Amy: Well, clearly mental tasks are not enough. Maybe you need to challenge your motor skills.", "Sheldon: For the last time, I am not having a tickle fight with you.", "Raj: You want a real challenge, try keeping me from eating more of these.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re just using food to mask the fear that you\u2019re fundamentally unlovable and therefore going to be alone forever.", "Raj: Damn it, he\u2019s good at that, too.", "Scene: The restaurant. ", "Zack: Thanks. Wow, working on a top secret government project, that is so cool. Do you have a bodyguard to keep spies away?", "Leonard: I have Sheldon, that keeps most people away.", "Zack: I miss that guy. He\u2019s like the Swedish Chef Muppet. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s saying, but he\u2019s funny.", "Leonard: Oh, I know what he\u2019s saying, and he\u2019s not, he\u2019s not funny.", "Zack: So, Penny, what\u2019s going on with you? How\u2019s the job?", "Penny: Uh, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019m still in pharmaceutical sales.", "Leonard: She\u2019s doing amazing. She can actually make a side effect, like 10% chance of liver failure, sound like a 90% chance of liver success.", "Penny: Yeah, lying isn\u2019t my favourite part of the job. Actually, I\u2019m not crazy about a lot of it.", "Zack: Hey, if you\u2019re not happy there, I\u2019ve been looking for a new head of sales at my company. And we don\u2019t sell drugs, just menus, so the only lie you\u2019ll be telling is we print on recycled paper. We don\u2019t.", "Penny: Oh, that\u2019s a nice offer.", "Zack: You know, we\u2019d make a great team. Or as we say in the menu business, I can\u2019t do this without Me N U.", "Penny: Right, \u2019cause it spells menu.", "Zack: Yeah, right? It\u2019s funny. I got a lot of menu jokes, but that\u2019s my favourite.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Howard: All right, this is everything. What do you want to learn?", "Sheldon: It really doesn\u2019t matter, as long as it\u2019s challenging.", "Howard: Okay, well, how about, oh, I teach you some close-up magic.", "Sheldon: Howard, I\u2019m trying to make myself uncomfortable, not everyone else.", "Bernadette: So you wanted to learn something physical and you came to Howard Wolowitz?", "Howard: Hey, the circus arts are very physically and mentally demanding. Have you ever tried to juggle?", "Bernadette: Yes, I\u2019m juggling my love for you and my embarrassment of you right now.", "Howard: And it\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it? So the key is, the moment one ball is at the top of its arc, you toss the next one. Hmm?", "Sheldon: Okay, I think I got that.", "Howard: Uh, hold on. There\u2019s an old saying in juggling.", "Bernadette: Is it I\u2019m going to die alone?", "Howard: No, it\u2019s if you want to have fun, start with one. Yours we think, but we do not say. All right, just toss it up and catch it a few times, get comfortable with it.", "Sheldon: Okay. Just to be on the safe side, am I in any danger of getting juggler\u2019s elbow?", "Howard: No.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? \u2018Cause I\u2019m feeling a twinge.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car. ", "Penny: See, that wasn\u2019t so bad. He even picked up the check.", "Leonard: Yeah. Although, when he was trying to figure out the tip, I\u2019m pretty sure I saw smoke coming out of his ears. You\u2019re not really considering working for him, are you?", "Penny: Well, maybe, I mean, it seems kind of perfect. I have sales experience, and I\u2019ve been a waitress, so I have restaurant experience, and if he\u2019s figuring out my Christmas bonus, we could buy a boat.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t you think it might be a little weird to work for someone you used to date?", "Penny: You work with Sheldon, you tell me.", "Leonard: Yeah, it\u2019s weird.", "Penny: Okay, are you seriously jealous of me working with Zack?", "Leonard: No, no, I\u2019m not jealous, I just think you have got a good thing going where you are right now, and you make great money and you haven\u2019t slept with any of your co-workers.", "Penny: Great, so you want me to stay at a job I\u2019m not happy at?", "Leonard: Uh.", "Penny: You okay? You kind of look like Zack trying to figure out that tip.", "Leonard: Of course I don\u2019t want you to be unhappy, but I also want you to be smart, and working for an ex-boyfriend isn\u2019t very smart. You don\u2019t have to stop, just slow down, I\u2019ll jump out.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: Amy, look, I\u2019m on a unicycle!", "Amy: How did you get from croissants to a unicycle?", "Sheldon: I hurt myself juggling.", "Amy: Where did you get it?", "Sheldon: Howard said I could borrow it, Bernadette said forever.", "Amy: Have you tried letting go of the rope?", "Sheldon: What, are you crazy? I\u2019m on a unicycle.", "Amy: All right, well, have fun.", "Sheldon: Wait, I need help getting down.", "Amy: Well, what do you want me to do?", "Sheldon: Drag out our mattress and put it over here, then go across the hall, get their mattress and put it over here. But before you do any of that, scratch my nose.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Howard: So you told her she was being dumb?", "Leonard: No, I told her she was being not smart. Which was dumb.", "Raj: Why did you even go to dinner with the guy?", "Leonard: We covered this, I\u2019m dumb.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Penny: So he\u2019s my ex-boyfriend, who cares? I can\u2019t believe Leonard would be so insecure.", "Bernadette: Really? I have no trouble believing that at all.", "Penny: And Zack\u2019s engaged. Leonard has no reason to feel threatened.", "Bernadette: We\u2019re talking about the same Leonard, right?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: So you think it\u2019s fine if she works for Zack?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know, maybe.", "Raj: Well, he is much more attractive than Leonard.", "Howard: Yes, but that\u2019s gonna be true of a lot of guys she works for.", "Leonard: Yeah, but she also used to sleep with Zack.", "Howard: Again.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Bernadette: I would never let Howard work with an ex.", "Penny: What, you wouldn\u2019t trust him?", "Bernadette: I wouldn\u2019t trust her. He\u2019s thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.", "Penny: Yeah, that, that is the sexiest dog.", "Bernadette: And I\u2019d like to think Howie wouldn\u2019t take a job I was uncomfortable with.", "Penny: \u2018Cause he\u2019s scared of you?", "Bernadette: Terrified.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Howard: You know what? I\u2019m with Leonard, this isn\u2019t cool.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Raj: I disagree. Penny is a strong, independent woman. The more you try to control her, the more she\u2019ll push back.", "Leonard: So you think it\u2019s okay?", "Raj: Oh, no, she\u2019s gonna leave you for someone, might as well get it over with.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m returning this stuff to Howard.", "Amy: Oh. Well, Bernadette made me promise if you didn\u2019t want it, we\u2019d give it to a homeless clown. What happened to learning the unicycle?", "Sheldon: Oh, I stopped that, it was dumb. Uni, bi, tri, menstrual, all cycles are dumb.", "Amy: You said juggling was dumb, too.", "Sheldon: Well, it is. If I wanted to hold three things at once, I\u2019d wear cargo pants.", "Amy: Sheldon, is it possible that when things get really difficult, you just give up?", "Sheldon: Are you calling me a quitter?", "Amy: Well, if you honestly\u2026", "Sheldon: This conversation is over.", "Amy: His mother warned me. Everybody warned me. Actually, he warned me.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: Hi.", "Penny: You want to talk?", "Leonard: That doesn\u2019t seem to be where I shine. How about I just give you one of these?", "Penny: Look, we can have a reasonable conversation and I won\u2019t get mad. I don\u2019t like it after sex, and I don\u2019t like it now.", "Leonard: Yeah, sorry.", "Penny: Yeah. All right, just come here. Look, I get me working with Zack is weird and I don\u2019t want you to be uncomfortable. ", "Leonard: Well, thanks. And I don\u2019t want you to be stuck at a job you don\u2019t like.", "Penny: Then what do we do?", "Leonard: Well, I don\u2019t love it, but if you really want to take this job, I\u2019ll find a way to deal with it.", "Penny: No, I know you\u2019ll try, but it\u2019ll make you miserable, which will make me miserable, and I\u2019m just gonna stay where I\u2019m at for now.", "Leonard: No, no, no, no, you\u2019re, you\u2019re unhappy there and then you\u2019re gonna blame me for making you stay, and it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just, I\u2019ll suck it up.", "Penny: You don\u2019t need to do that, it\u2019s okay.", "Leonard: Yeah, see, now I feel terrible, like I\u2019m being selfish and holding you back. What? Say something. Yeah, that is pretty annoying.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s bedroom. ", "Amy: I made you tea.", "Sheldon: Thank you.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry I called you a quitter.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s okay, I stopped being upset about that. And no, the irony is not lost on me.", "Amy: What are you reading?", "Sheldon: This article says the peak age for making a Nobel Prize-winning discovery is 40. ", "Amy: So?", "Sheldon: So I\u2019m running out of time.", "Amy: That\u2019s ridiculous, you\u2019re a brilliant man. The best years of your life are still ahead of you.", "Sheldon: Oh, you have to say that, you\u2019re sweet on me.", "Amy: Well, if you\u2019re really worried about your career, maybe you should consider spending a little less time with video games and comic books.", "Sheldon: Hey, I thought you were sweet on me.", "Amy: Okay, fine, let\u2019s say you never win a Nobel Prize. Let\u2019s say you spend your life doing solid scientific research surrounded by friends and loved ones who appreciate you, not for what you\u2019ve accomplished but for who you are as a man. Wouldn\u2019t that be a life well-lived?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re so cute. I\u2019m gonna go learn how to walk on stilts.", "Amy: So many warnings.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Okay, are you sure about this?", "Leonard: Absolutely. I just want you to be happy. And maybe a little turned on about how selfless I\u2019m being.", "Zack (on phone): Penny, what\u2019s up?", "Penny: Hey, uh, so I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I want to take the job.", "Zack: Oh, bad news. When my fianc\u00e9e found out that I was offering a job to my ex-girlfriend, she said it was a stupid idea and threw a shoe at me.", "Penny: Oh, so there\u2019s no job?", "Zack: Nope, just a little bump on my forehead.", "Penny: Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. Well, his fianc\u00e9e thought the idea of us working together was stupid. You were right, I was wrong. Aren\u2019t you gonna say anything?", "Leonard: Not if I want to be doing this later.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Bernadette: Hey, I didn\u2019t know you were home. Where you been?", "Howard: I went to see your mom.", "Bernadette: Seriously, where were you?", "Howard: I just told you, your mom\u2019s.", "Bernadette: Why?", "Howard: Well, since you find my magic tricks so embarrassing, I got to wondering what cool hobbies you had as a kid.", "Bernadette: Oh. What\u2019d she say?", "Howard: She didn\u2019t say much of anything. But she said a lot. (Through ventriloquist\u2019s doll) Hi, Bernadette, remember me?", "Bernadette: First of all, that\u2019s not what she sounds like, she\u2019s from South Carolina.", "Howard: I can\u2019t believe you made fun of me all these years while you were a closeted ventriloquist.", "Bernadette: Okay, it\u2019s not like I wanted to be a ventriloquist. I was in beauty pageants and I needed a talent besides spreading rumours that the other contestants were pregnant.", "Howard: Well, since you enjoyed getting rid of all my stuff, you know, maybe we should throw this little lady in the wood chipper.", "Bernadette: No. And the little lady has a name.", "Howard: Which is?", "Bernadette: Tammy Jo St. Cloud.", "Howard: Tammy Jo St. Cloud. Oh, and I\u2019m a dork for juggling.", "Bernadette: Sorry, you\u2019re not a dork. (Through doll) You\u2019re a clown. (Bernadette) Tammy Jo, don\u2019t say that, you\u2019ll make him feel bad. (Doll) Look at him, what reason he got to feel good?", "Howard: All right, very funny.", "Bernadette: Don\u2019t listen to her, she\u2019s been in a box for, like, 25 years. (Doll) Yeah, back when his haircut was fashionable.", "Howard: That\u2019s enough, put her away.", "Bernadette (as Doll): Oh, big daddy, I don\u2019t think so. You marry Miss Bernie, you marry me. We all family now.", "Howard: All right, you\u2019re freaking me out.", "Bernadette (as Doll): Don\u2019t be that way. If you don\u2019t mind a few splinters, we can have us a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. Ooh.", "Scene: A street. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m doing it. I\u2019m tall and I\u2019m doing it. (Waking up in bed) Ah, man."]}
