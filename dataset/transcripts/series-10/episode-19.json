", "Penny: Yeah, I guess they don\u2019t have Sanskrit for butts up and heads down.", "Raj: Hey, we wrote the Kama Sutra. If it involves butts, there\u2019s a word for it.", "Leonard: I thought we were getting breakfast before work.", "Penny: Oh, right, sorry.", "Raj: It\u2019s my fault. I asked Penny to do yoga with me.", "Penny: If you want, I can get ready in five minutes.", "Leonard: It\u2019s cute that you think that. Don\u2019t worry about it.", "Raj: Hey, can I ask you a favour? Would you mind taking Cinnamon for a walk?", "Leonard: Sure. You\u2019re living here for free, I guess I owe you.", "Raj: Bye, Cinnamon. Be a good girl.", "Penny: Yeah, bye, sweetie.", "Leonard: Bye.", "Penny: Yeah, yeah, bye, Leonard.", "Raj: Okay, and tree pose.", "Leonard: Well, she\u2019s done.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Amy\u2019s car.", "Sheldon: Things have been going really well with the infinite resistance gyroscope.", "Amy: That\u2019s great. How so?", "Sheldon: Oh, the project is classified. I can\u2019t tell you. Oh, I suppose I could redact the classified parts. All right, um, I came up with an elegant solution to the (honks horn) I used the (honks horn) And then I (honks horn) And that did it. (Car passes honking horn) Wow, I wonder what they\u2019re redacting.", "Amy: Why don\u2019t you ask me what I\u2019m working on?", "Sheldon: Oh, very well. What have you been working on? And feel free to honk during the boring parts.", "Amy: I\u2019m doing some experiments to show that the signal to move a muscle occurs before you know you even decided to move it.", "Sheldon: So you\u2019re attempting to pinpoint where consciousness resides in the brain.", "Amy: Yes, I\u2019m trying to figure out to the nanometer and the attosecond, precisely where and when an event of awareness takes place.", "Sheldon: Well, what do you know? Here I was, waiting to be bored with biology, and instead you tickle my intellectual fancy. Which, unlike my body, is an okay place to tickle.", "Amy: You know, when I was six, I wanted to marry the gorilla from Good Night, Gorilla. Maybe I was onto something.", "Scene: The cafeteria. ", "Sheldon: Gentlemen, the most interesting thing just happened with this spoon.", "Howard: Unless it was singing Be Our Guest, I doubt it.", "Sheldon: Yeah, I picked it up without thinking about it. Which raises a neuroscientific question, when did I decide to pick it up?", "Raj: The bigger question is, what are you gonna eat with that spoon? You didn\u2019t get any food.", "Leonard: He does raise an interesting point.", "Sheldon: Amy is studying the time lag between intent and awareness, and I realized that applies to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics. Now, I recognize there will be a time lag between me saying that and you Googling what it means, so I\u2019ll wait.", "Leonard: I understand it, Sheldon.", "Raj: Yeah, me, too.", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, I spaced. Are we still talking about the spoon?", "Raj: It\u2019s nice to see you taking an interest in Amy\u2019s work.", "Sheldon: Well, don\u2019t get me wrong. Neurobiology\u2019s nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff. But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we\u2019re going for a drive.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: So did you confront Jennifer?", "Penny: No, I was going to, but she called in sick. And guess who else called in sick.", "Raj: Paul.", "Penny: Paul.", "Leonard: Who\u2019s Paul?", "Penny: Oh, you met him at the office Christmas party. He\u2019s married to Nancy.", "Leonard: Oh, sure. Wait, Nancy?", "Penny: I bet Jennifer gets a promotion out of this, which is so unfair because I work twice as hard as she does.", "Raj: Don\u2019t worry, Jerry won\u2019t be fooled by that type of behaviour.", "Leonard: Jerry?", "Raj: It didn\u2019t work for Randy, it didn\u2019t work for Tina, it sure as hell isn\u2019t gonna work for Jennifer.", "Penny: Well, I hope not. I just hate when people play those kinds of games.", "Leonard: Tina?", "Raj: With your sales record, you have nothing to worry about.", "Penny: Mm.", "Leonard: I went to your office Christmas party?", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: You know, I like harp lessons, but I\u2019m thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons. What are you working on?", "Sheldon: I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.", "Amy: Wait, are you saying if we combine my experiment with your calculations, we can determine the precise moment in time when the wave function collapses?", "Sheldon: It could be the most inspired combination since I mixed red Icee into my blue Icee. It was like drinking two sevenths of the rainbow.", "Amy: Sheldon, this is really interesting.", "Sheldon: Yeah, and this one won\u2019t stain my teeth purple.", "Amy: You know, we\u2019ve never collaborated professionally before. Are you worried it might affect our relationship?", "Sheldon: That is a valid point. Perhaps we should establish some ground rules.", "Amy: Well, that would make me feel better.", "Sheldon: All right, let\u2019s start right now. Uh, rule number one, no using sexuality to get your way.", "Amy: That\u2019s a ridiculous rule.", "Sheldon: Is it?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: Okay, how is that?", "Raj: I can actually feel the toxins being pulled out of my skin.", "Penny: Well, this is a moisturizing mask.", "Raj: Oh, well, then I can actually feel the moisture going into my skin. ", "Penny: Hey, I hope you don\u2019t mind, I used a little of your eye cream last night.", "Raj: I thought someone looked brighter and tighter.", "Leonard: I\u2019d still like to know who Jerry is.", "Penny: Don\u2019t worry about it. Hey, after this, how about we all go out and do something together?", "Leonard: That would be great. Thank you.", "Raj: You want to go shopping?", "Penny: Ooh, yes. Fun.", "Leonard: Or we could do something we\u2019ll all enjoy, like play a board game.", "Montage of shopping scenes. ", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: I believe I\u2019ve made some progress on our ground rules.", "Amy: Oh, good. What are they?", "Sheldon: Okay, uh, number one, in matters of physics, I have the final say. In matters of neuroscience, you have the final say. Unless I disagree. Oh, here. Number two, when we publish,", "my name goes first. Oh, subsequently, if we win any awards, I speak first. I don\u2019t want to be talking when the orchestra plays us off.", "Amy: Can I see that?", "Sheldon: Oh, of course. I\u2019ll get that back. Like all my underwear, that notebook says Property of Sheldon Cooper.", "Amy: Sheldon, if we\u2019re gonna have ground rules, I\u2019ll tell you the first ground rule. I make the ground rules.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d write that down, but I can\u2019t now, can I?", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s minivan. ", "Leonard: I mean, they didn\u2019t say anything, but I just kind of felt like I was being a weird third wheel.", "Howard: Huh, so you can tell what that feels like. Interesting.", "Leonard: Anyway, I figured I can hang out with my friends and have fun, too.", "Bernadette: Well, if your idea of fun is riding in a minivan to Target for diapers, things are about to get nuts.", "Leonard: Oh, it\u2019s just nice to be with people who are happy to have me around. Isn\u2019t that right, Halley?", "Halley: (cries)", "Howard: Well, at least someone had the courage to say it.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s door. ", "Sheldon: Thank you, you are a good citizen. Told you. Go ahead, throw my underwear out the window. Same thing\u2019s gonna happen.", "Amy: Terrific. Do you want to hear our new set of ground rules?", "Sheldon: Fire away.", "Amy: Number one, we\u2019re on the same team, we\u2019re not in competition.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s smart, because Sheldon 1, Amy 0.", "Amy: Number two, disagreements can happen politely. There\u2019s no need to call an idea stupid.", "Sheldon: Aw, someone drew a penis in it.", "Amy: Are you listening?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.", "Amy: Number three, to avoid getting frustrated, we take built-in breaks and reward our successes with a small treat.", "Sheldon: Ooh, that sounds fun. Now, we\u2019re talking about real treats, right? Not Bible verses like my mother used to give me.", "Amy: Whatever you want. So, shall we get to work?", "Sheldon: Biology and physics coming together, this is like the peanut butter cup of the mind. Oh, I know what I want my treat to be.", "Montage of Sheldon and Amy working together. ", "Amy: Wow. Look at that.", "Sheldon: Yes, this is remarkable.", "Amy: So we\u2019re agreed, it\u2019s complete garbage.", "Sheldon: By the way, your name can go first.", "Scene: Inside a store. ", "Leonard: I mean, I\u2019m glad they\u2019re getting along, but it\u2019s starting to make me uncomfortable.", "Bernadette: Well, are you worried he\u2019s like another man in her life?", "Leonard: A little, until I saw them in matching tops.", "Howard: Nice. 174 diapers. That ought to get us to Wednesday.", "Bernadette: Well, have you talked to them about it?", "Leonard: Well, what am I supposed to say, stop having fun without me?", "Howard: This one says that every time I go out. See? I listen to you.", "Bernadette: Look, Raj just gets along with women. ", "Leonard: I know, but he was my friend first. It\u2019s like she\u2019s stealing him and they\u2019re just having the best time doing all their dumb girly stuff together.", "Howard: You sure you don\u2019t fit in? You sound like a catty bitch to me.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: I don\u2019t know where we went wrong.", "Sheldon: Yeah, the math is so inelegant. I\u2019m not even sure it makes sense.", "Amy: Well, don\u2019t give up. Maybe we can fix it.", "Sheldon: Can you stop breathing so loud? I can hear your nose whistling.", "Amy: I can hear your face talking, so we\u2019re even.", "Sheldon: All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play Camptown Races.", "Amy: Fine. Fine. You want me to blow my nose? Here, I\u2019ll blow it. Better?", "Sheldon: No, I can still hear it. Oh, wait, that\u2019s me. Never mind, it\u2019s fine.", "Amy: You know, you\u2019re exhausting. I knew working together was a bad idea.", "Sheldon: Hold on. I see what\u2019s wrong here. We did the propagation only to the occipital lobe, not to the prefrontal cortex.", "Amy: That would mean that this delayed parameter should be increased 250 milliseconds.", "Sheldon: Oh, that is much better. Yeah, boy, if good ideas came out of your brain the way mucus comes out of your nose, we\u2019d be in good shape.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Now, take a sip, swirl it around your mouth, and try to notice the flavours, the tannins, the textures. Well?", "Penny: I probably should have spit out my gum first.", "Raj: Yeah. You know, the last couple of weeks have been pretty rough, but, uh, staying here with you guys has really helped take my mind off of it.", "Penny: Mm. Well, we\u2019ve loved having you around. Right, sweetie? Leonard?", "Raj: When did he leave?", "Penny: Yeah, that\u2019s rude.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s minivan.", "Leonard: You know, it\u2019s nice to spend time with people who don\u2019t talk about work like it\u2019s some kind of soap opera.", "Bernadette: Jennifer still trying to sleep her way to the top?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Howard: You should be happy someone wants to do the stuff with Penny you don\u2019t want to.", "Bernadette: Yeah, I wish I had that with Howard.", "Howard: Wait. What? What do I make you do?", "Bernadette: Let\u2019s see, the magic store, the Doctor Who convention, the National Belt Buckle Collector\u2019s meet and greet.", "Howard: It said right there on the invitation, buckle up for fun. It\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019t listen.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sure I\u2019m overreacting.", "Bernadette: You\u2019re entitled to feel how you feel. If you don\u2019t like it, you should just talk to her.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to sound like a jealous baby.", "Bernadette: Oh, then maybe you shouldn\u2019t talk to her.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: I had a feeling you were using the wrong computational model, but I didn\u2019t say anything \u2019cause you\u2019re so sensitive.", "Sheldon: Just because I am easily bothered by light, heat, sound, smell and the way birds look at me does not mean I\u2019m sensitive.", "Amy: Hey, I wonder what kind of success we\u2019d have if we defined measurement as the first moment that an action potential is seen by the visual cortex.", "Sheldon: That is a daring and insightful solution. ", "Amy: We\u2019re finally making progress. I wish we could do it without fighting.", "Sheldon: What if the fighting is the reason we\u2019re making progress?", "Amy: I suppose it\u2019s conceivable that the hormones associated with our fight-or-flight response could be sharpening our cognitive processes.", "Sheldon: Well, if that\u2019s the case, then your grandparents mumble and have bad posture.", "Amy: How dare you speak that way about my Grammy and hey, wait a second. Wait. Delta T could equal alpha sub-zero.", "Sheldon: It seems we have a choice to make. Abandon all ground rules in the name of science, or give up collaborating for the sake of our relationship.", "Amy: There\u2019s only one clear choice.", "Sheldon: Science it is.", "Amy: No, you bonehead.", "Sheldon: Name calling, that is perfect. Now, when I get to this equation here, really let me have it. You know? If it helps, I\u2019m not the sharpest dresser.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Leonard: Anyway, I know it\u2019s silly, but since Raj moved in, I\u2019ve been feeling a little left out.", "Penny: Well, sweetie, that\u2019s crazy.", "Raj: No, no, Penny, don\u2019t dismiss his feelings.", "Leonard: Thank you. I just feel\u2026", "Raj: Hang on, I\u2019m not saying that his feelings aren\u2019t crazy. I just don\u2019t want him to think that this isn\u2019t a safe place.", "Leonard: Well, to be truthful\u2026", "Penny: Well, why wouldn\u2019t this be a safe place? I mean, he\u2019s surrounded by his wife and one of his best friends.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want to speak for Leonard.", "Leonard: Thank you. I\u2026", "Raj: But when you\u2019re insecure, no amount of external validation can ever make you feel safe.", "Penny: Yeah, you\u2019re right. You know, you\u2019re really sensitive about this kind of stuff.", "Raj: I\u2019m a good listener.", "Penny: Yeah.", "Leonard: Hey, Olsen twins\u2026", "Penny: What?", "Leonard: Well, I mean, I\u2019m sitting right here. You\u2019re talking about my feelings and somehow leaving me out of the conversation.", "Raj: I\u2019m sorry. What did you want to say?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, you pretty much covered it.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: Can you read them back?", "Amy: Revised ground rule number one, we are on the same team, but it is a competition.", "Sheldon: Excellent. Excellent. And on a related point, you\u2019re going down, punk.", "Amy: Revised ground rule number two, there are definitely stupid questions, and those who ask them can be told so right to their stupid face.", "Sheldon: I love that one.", "Amy: Thanks, babe. Number three, fair topics for insult include educational pedigree, scientific field, intellectual prowess, and mamas.", "Sheldon: Yeah, that list is strong. Like your mother\u2019s urge to be promiscuous with sailors."]}
