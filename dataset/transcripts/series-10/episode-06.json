It\u2019s a dinky little convention where they sell collectibles and get sad D-list celebrities to appear. Why?", "Penny: I got asked to sign autographs there.", "Leonard: That\u2019s awesome. Is this for Serial Ape-ist?", "Penny: Well, it could be for the monkey movie. It could be my haemorrhoid commercial. The list does not go on.", "Leonard: When is it?", "Penny: It doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not doing it.", "Leonard: What? Why not?", "Penny: You just said yourself, it\u2019s sad.", "Leonard: Yeah, but it\u2019s not pathetic, that\u2019s where I draw the line. Come on, we\u2019ll have fun.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know.", "Leonard: You\u2019ll have nerds fawning all over you. If you don\u2019t love that, this marriage is in trouble.", "Penny: I guess it wouldn\u2019t hurt to meet some fans and make a little extra money.", "Leonard: Yeah. Wow, An appearance by George Lucas\u2026 \u2018s dermatologist. Oh, I want that autograph.", "Penny: Oh, yeah.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment.", "Amy: You know, with us living together, maybe we could think about having people over.", "Sheldon: We have people over all the time. We have the maintenance people, the pizza delivery man, that UPS driver who feels the need to ask how parts of me are hanging.", "Amy: You know what I meant.", "Sheldon: All right, fine. Let\u2019s say that we were to entertain people. What type of gathering did you have in mind? Huh? A meal? Lunch? Brunch? Dinner? Afternoon tea? A formal tea? Hmm? Is it a party? And if so, what kind of party? Is it a cocktail party? A Tupperware party? Ooh, is it a surprise party? Oh, I hope it\u2019s not a West Coast party, \u2019cause according to the man on the radio, a West Coast party don\u2019t stop.", "Amy: I\u2019m sorry I mentioned it.", "Sheldon: Oh, don\u2019t be. You get your hopes up, I knock them down. That\u2019s called teamwork.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s bedroom.", "Howard: That\u2019s a kick. That\u2019s an actual kick.", "Bernadette: What are you doing?", "Howard: I felt a kick. There\u2019s a baby in there.", "Bernadette: Oh, yeah, that\u2019s where I put it.", "Howard: Oh, I mean, I know you\u2019re pregnant. I just never connected the idea of pregnancy and you actually having a baby.", "Bernadette: Which MIT did you go to?", "Howard: Oh, God, we are not ready to have an infant in this house. We don\u2019t have a crib, we don\u2019t have diapers, we\u2019re not baby-proofed. Anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids!", "Bernadette: Howie, we have time to do all that stuff.", "Howard: Do we? Look at you. Willy Wonka would roll you to the juicing room.", "Bernadette: The next person kicking you will be me. Good night.", "Howard: Are we even in a good school\u2026? Ow!", "Bernadette: I warned you, and I did it.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Penny: What\u2019s all this?", "Leonard: Oh, everything we need for your autograph session, head shots, markers.", "Penny: Okay. Leonard, it\u2019s sweet you\u2019re excited about this, but it\u2019ll be a miracle if one person asks for my autograph.", "Leonard: Are you kidding? I once paid twenty dollars for Theo Sassler\u2019s signature.", "Penny: Who\u2019s that?", "Leonard: Oh, I don\u2019t even know. I just liked his name. Theo Sassler. Okay, and look at this. I even got a change maker. How much change you want, little lady?", "Penny: Oh, there\u2019s so much I want to change.", "Leonard: Yeah, well, if it\u2019s a dollar, you\u2019re in luck.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: What\u2019s going on here?", "Sheldon: You expressed an interest in having people over, and I feel I dismissed it too quickly. So, I took matters into my own hands, and I arranged a brunch.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s so nice. Who\u2019s coming?", "Sheldon: Oh, uh, Stuart, Bert from the geology lab, and Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.", "Amy: You mean the Romanian lady on the second floor?", "Sheldon: Yes. Oh, fun story, she grew up with ten siblings. Or possibly penguins. Her English is atrocious.", "Amy: That\u2019s an odd mix of people.", "Sheldon: Well, for our first time hosting, I thought it would be wise to conduct a trial run. You know, like how I practiced for that Halloween haunted house by going into the bathroom at the bus station.", "Amy: You never went into that haunted house.", "Sheldon: You never saw what jumped out at me at the bus station.", "Amy: Well, thank you, Sheldon. This is a fun surprise.", "Sheldon: Oh. Well, the real surprise is how surprised you are that I\u2019m great at surprises.", "Amy: Well, that\u2019s not a surprise at all. I mean, if I knew you were good at surprises, I would have", "expected the surprise, and therefore not have been surprised, but as it is, I didn\u2019t know, and therefore my surprise should be unsurprising.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t get me all randy. Guests are on the way.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s kitchen. ", "Howard: Hi.", "Bernadette: Hey, where you been?", "Howard: Oh, we went and did a little shopping for the baby.", "Raj: Wait till you see the crib we found.", "Bernadette: You bought a crib without me?", "Howard: You\u2019re gonna love it.", "Raj: Yeah, it\u2019s the highest rated one on the market. I wouldn\u2019t even call it a crib, I\u2019d call it a Fortress of Solitude for babies.", "Bernadette: Sounds expensive.", "Howard: Okay, well, I may have gone a bit overboard, but you can\u2019t put a price on safety. ", "Raj: Though if you did, it\u2019s more zeroes than you\u2019re expecting.", "Howard: But it\u2019s the safest crib you can buy. And if you don\u2019t like it, we can return it.", "Bernadette: Fine.", "Howard: In our new minivan. Hey, what\u2019s for lunch?", "Bernadette: You bought a minivan?", "Howard: It\u2019s for the baby, and I didn\u2019t buy it. The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.", "Raj: Though we did ding up the back pretty good with the crib, so you might have bought a minivan.", "Bernadette: I don\u2019t want to drive that. It\u2019s such a mom car.", "Howard: The guy at the dealership said they\u2019re not just for moms anymore. ", "Raj: Then again, he did think you were my husband.", "Bernadette: They thought it at the ultrasound, why not at the car dealership?", "Scene: The Comic-con.", "Leonard: Never been on this side of the table before. I feel powerful.", "Penny: Really? I feel like I\u2019m selling candy so our team can get new uniforms.", "Leonard: Okay, so it\u2019s four seventy-five for a signed black-and-white and nine ninety-five for a colour. ", "Penny: Alright, why not five and ten bucks?", "Leonard: Well, I brought my moneymaker. Let me shake it. ", "Penny: Hey, that guy\u2019s looking over here. ", "Leonard: Oh. You think he\u2019s your first autograph?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know. Be cool. He\u2019s coming. He\u2019s coming. Hi. ", "Guy: Hi. I love your movie. ", "Penny: Well, thanks.", "Guy: It has got to be one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.", "Penny: Your love confuses me. ", "Leonard: Would you like an autograph?", "Guy: Sure.", "Penny: Okay. Who do I make it out to?", "Guy: Daniel.", "Penny: Okay.", "Daniel: I have to ask. Were you trying to be that bad, or are you just a terrible actress? ", "Penny: That did not clear things up.", "Leonard: That\u2019ll be four seventy-five.", "Daniel: Keep the change.", "Leonard: But I-I-I, oh. Nothing about that was good.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Amy: There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: The average cork speed is 25 miles per hour. If that is too fast around a school, it is certainly too fast around a kitchen.", "Amy: Been 15 minutes. Just sayin\u2019.", "Sheldon: Okay. I can do this. Just give me a moment\u2026 Oh! Mimosas coming up.", "Bert: I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.", "Amy: How old was it", "Bert: It\u2019s hard to say. I don\u2019t remember much after I drank it.", "Sheldon: Would you like one, Mrs. Petrescu?", "Mrs Petrescu: Yes. Drink is fun and good friends, Applebee\u2019s.", "Sheldon: She\u2019s learning English from TV.", "Mrs Petrescu: TV, good. Now back to you.", "Stuart: Hey, guys.", "Amy: Hi, Stuart.", "Stuart: These are for you.", "Amy: Oh, they\u2019re pretty. Thank you.", "Sheldon: Stuart, this is Bert from the Caltech geology lab, and this is Mrs. Petrescu from downstairs.", "Stuart: Nice to meet you.", "Mrs Petrescu: Hello.", "Bert: Hey.", "Stuart: So, what did I miss?", "Bert: Eh, we watched Sheldon try to open a bottle for 15 minutes.", "Mrs Petrescu: 15 minutes can save you 15% or more on car insurance.", "Stuart: Anybody else coming to this thing?", "Scene: The Comic-con.", "Penny: What\u2019s your name?", "Jeff: Jeff.", "Penny: Okay.", "Jeff: My favourite part is your shower scene.", "Penny: Been hearing that a lot today.", "Jeff: I even have a screen grab on my phone.", "Penny: Yep, there they are.", "Leonard: Okay, let\u2019s keep it moving.", "Penny: Here you go. ", "Leonard: Should\u2019ve punched that guy.", "Penny: Well, go ahead. He\u2019s right over there.", "Leonard: Why do you do that? Can\u2019t you let me have my moment?", "Penny: Hello.", "Awkward guy: Hi. I like your movies.", "Penny: Thank you.", "Awkward guy: I saw both of them.", "Penny: I assume we\u2019re still talking about the movies, but after today, who knows.", "Awkward guy: You think I could get a picture of us?", "Penny: Oh, sure.", "Awkward guy: And, uh, could you be giving me a kiss?", "Leonard: No. She cannot kiss. What is wrong with you people?", "Penny: Leonard\u2026", "Leonard: No, no, no. It\u2019s not okay.", "Awkward guy: Who are you?", "Leonard: I\u2019m her husband.", "Awkward guy: No, you\u2019re not.", "Leonard: I am.", "Penny: Yeah, he really is.", "Awkward guy: No.", "Scene: Howard and Bernadette\u2019s garage.", "Howard: It\u2019s got a rearview camera, there\u2019s a DVD player, oh, and check this out. It\u2019s like we\u2019re living in the future.", "Raj: Hey, show her the trunk. Show her the trunk.", "Howard: Imagine this, you\u2019ve got the baby in one hand, groceries in the other, and you\u2019re thinking, how am I gonna open this trunk?", "Bernadette: I\u2019m probably thinking, where\u2019s my husband, and why isn\u2019t he helping me?", "Howard: You don\u2019t need my help when you can open the trunk with a simple kick of the foot.", "Raj: No, it\u2019s a gentle kick, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Here. Give me those.", "Howard: Uh, maybe it was more of a circle?", "Bernadette: It\u2019s weird that guy thought you were a couple.", "Howard: Yes.", "Raj: Yes.", "Howard: See? Easy. And look at all this cargo space. Now we\u2019ll get the crib out and you can take it for a test-drive. I\u2019m telling you, this van is gonna be\u2026 uuh-uuh, uuh-uuh.", "Bernadette: Oh, is it your back?", "Howard: Oh, yeah, oh, anyway, let\u2019s just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: So until Amy\u2019s apartment is fixed, she and I are living here together.", "Bert: I lived with my old girlfriend. She was a geologist, too.", "Amy: Things didn\u2019t work out?", "Bert: I came home from work one day and she had taken everything. I\u2019m warning you, hide your good rocks.", "Mrs Petrescu: My sister\u2019s husband took all her things, too. Story at eleven.", "Stuart: Really, no one else is coming?", "Sheldon: This is it. You are the practice round.", "Stuart: Practice round? For-for what?", "Amy: Uh, no. He, he just means that you were the first people we thought of.", "Sheldon: You know, exactly. We\u2019ve never thrown a brunch before, and I wanted to work out all the kinks.", "Stuart: So, I\u2019m like a lab rat before your real friends come over?", "Sheldon: Hmm. You see, your words sound reasonable, but your face looks angry. Help me out here, this is not where I shine.", "Amy: Stuart, you know you\u2019re one of our favourite people.", "Sheldon: Okay, now, see, you look sincere, but your words are completely false. I\u2019m glad we did this test run, these brunches are wild.", "Scene: The Comic-con. ", "Awkward guy: But how did you get her to go out with you?", "Leonard: Well, she moved in across the hall.", "Penny: And he started to slowly wear me down.", "Leonard: Like a river carves a canyon.", "Penny: Yeah, except the river kept showing me his Pok\u00e9mon cards.", "Red-haired guy: Ready to go?", "Awkward guy: Hang on. This guy\u2019s telling me how he got the Serial Ape-ist girl to marry him.", "Red-haired guy: This guy? But he\u2019s wearing a change maker.", "Penny: I think it\u2019s hot.", "Leonard: That\u2019s right. I\u2019m her change daddy.", "Scene: The minivan.", "Howard: Aaaaah. What was I thinking? Wolowitzes are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.", "Bernadette: Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room? They\u2019re just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.", "Howard: You\u2019re gonna feel terrible when I\u2019m in a wheelchair. Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.", "Bernadette: Fine, we\u2019ll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.", "Howard: You\u2019re right. It sells itself.", "Raj: You have to admit, it\u2019s a pretty smooth ride.", "Bernadette: I was hoping it\u2019d be quieter.", "Howard: If childbirth is half this bad, you are so screwed. Are we there yet?", "Bernadette: Soon.", "Howard: Why is it taking so long?", "Raj: Howard, Howard, look at the DVD screen. I put on Batman: The Animated Series. Your favourite.", "Howard: I\u2019m in too much pain to watch cartoo\u2026 oh, this is a good one.", "Raj: I\u2019ve been babysitting him way longer than you have.", "Bernadette: Fine. I\u2019ll buy the stupid van.", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Bert: This is the best blintz I\u2019ve ever had.", "Sheldon: Oh. Thank you. ", "Bert: It almost makes up for the incredibly awkward turn things took earlier.", "Stuart: You know what, I, I, I think I\u2019m just gonna go.", "Amy: No, Stuart, don\u2019t.", "Stuart: No, I consider you and Sheldon like my family, and I\u2019m not even sure you think of me as a friend. You have any idea how that feels?", "Amy: We\u2019re so sorry.", "Stuart: I\u2019m always the last one anybody thinks of.", "Sheldon: Well, no, that\u2019s not true. I mean, sometimes it\u2019s Koothrappali. But we\u2019re not supposed to say that \u2019cause he\u2019s a minority.", "Stuart: Bye.", "Sheldon: Stuart, wait. I do know what it feels like to be left out. ", "Bert: I know how it feels, too.", "Sheldon: All right, this is about me and him, you\u2019re not part of it. Stuart, perhaps we do take you for granted, and that is not acceptable. Please know that you truly are a valuable member of our social group.", "Stuart: Thank you.", "Sheldon: You know, in fact, I\u2019d like to propose a toast. To Stuart. A fine man, a good friend and a wonderful guest.", "Bert: Hear, hear.", "Amy: Cheers.", "Mrs Petrescu: Cheers. Filmed before a live studio audience.", "Scene: The Comic-con. ", "Leonard: And that is how a short asthmatic scientist landed a stone cold fox.", "Awkward guy: Oh. Whoa. I didn\u2019t know you can propose to the same person so many times.", "Leonard: The third time I did it in skywriting, but she never looked up.", "Penny: You know, once, I proposed to him.", "Leonard: Yeah. I said no.", "Red-haired guy: Why?", "Leonard: I just wanted to make her work for it.", "Penny: Yeah, that\u2019s gonna cost you later.", "Red-haired guy: Hang on. Is she just with you because you\u2019re rich?", "Leonard: She makes more money than I do.", "Awkward guy: What? Who are you?", "Scene: Sheldon and Amy\u2019s apartment. ", "Sheldon: Do you know what else I love about you?", "Stuart: Hmm?", "Sheldon: Your handwriting is impeccable.", "Stuart: Thank you for noticing.", "Sheldon: No, I mean it. I mean it. It\u2019s like you have the soul of a label maker.", "Stuart: You know what I love about you?", "Sheldon: Hmm?", "Stuart: You never leave the house without a paper clip.", "Sheldon: You never know when two pieces of paper might temporarily need fastening in the top left corner.", "Stuart: I also love how you never use swear words.", "Sheldon: You know, it turns out, you can hurt people just as well without \u2019em.", "Amy: Maybe I can get a little help putting some of this stuff away.", "Sheldon: Oh, calm down. I already put away five of these. You see? No muss, no fuss, not a single cuss."]}
