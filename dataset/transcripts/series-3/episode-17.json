{"series": "3", "episode": "17", "transcript": ["Scene: The stairwell. Leonard is carrying a large box.", "Leonard: Why do I always have to carry the heavy stuff?", "Sheldon: Well, it\u2019s very simple. In our ragtag band of scientists with nothing to lose, I\u2019m the smart one, Wolowitz is the funny one, and Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner who struggles to understand our ways and fails. That leaves you, by default, as the muscle.", "Leonard: One more floor, and I\u2019d be the pulled muscle.", "Penny (who is inside the apartment): Oh, it\u2019s about time, I\u2019m starving.", "Leonard: Uh, well, we didn\u2019t actually get Chinese food.", "Penny: Why not?", "Leonard: Don\u2019t panic, this is better.", "Penny: Oh, no, you didn\u2019t trade the food for magic beans, did you?", "Sheldon: Of course not. And, technically, magic beans would be food, although eating them would be quite a waste, since you could plant them and overnight have a giant beanstalk, which would provide enough roughage for a small city.", "Penny: Yeah, sometimes I don\u2019t listen, sometimes I just watch your jaw go up and down.", "Leonard: We were on our way to the Chinese restaurant when we thought we saw Adam West, so we followed him.", "Penny: Who\u2019s Adam West?", "Sheldon: Who\u2019s Adam West? Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus?", "Howard: My guess is, \u201cHey, four minutes! New record!\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m the funny one.", "Leonard: Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff.", "Howard: They were closing up. We got this whole box for sixty bucks.", "Leonard: We didn\u2019t even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here.", "Penny: There a new girlfriend in there? \u2018Cause you might need one.", "Leonard: No. But there is an original final draft Ghostbusters script with actual slime stains! (Raj whispers to Leonard) Oh, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s Ghostbusters 2. Never mind.", "Howard: Oh, my God. An Alf doll. When I was 11 my mother got me one to help me sleep after my dad left. I used to pretend that my dad had moved to the planet Melmac, and Alf was going to bring him back to me. But he never did. Where\u2019s my daddy, puppet? Where is he?", "Penny: That is so sad.", "Sheldon: No, what\u2019s sad is that you don\u2019t know Adam West was TV\u2019s Batman.", "Credits sequence", "\u00a0", "Scene: The same", "Leonard: Here\u2019s Spock\u2019s head with no body. Here\u2019s Mr. T\u2019s body with no head. Oh, yeah, here\u2019s Spock\u2019s body with Mr. T\u2019s head. I pity the fool who\u2019s illogical.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m just gonna go home and make a grilled cheese and window-shop on eHarmony.", "Leonard: Okay, bye.", "Penny: Okay.", "Leonard: Ooh, look, an Indiana Jones connect-the-dots.", "Raj: And an Aquaman action figure.", "Howard: Looks like someone drew a penis on him.", "Raj: Huh? That\u2019ll come off.", "Howard: You see what you\u2019re doing? Stop that.", "Sheldon: Fascinating.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: It appears to be a Lord of the Rings ring.", "Leonard: Oh.", "Raj: It\u2019s even got the Elvish engraving on it.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s not Elvish. It\u2019s the language of Mordor written in Elvish script. One Ring to", "rule them all.", "Raj: One Ring to find them.", "Howard: One Ring to bring them all.", "Leonard: And in the darkness bind them.", "Raj: Holy crap, are we nerdy.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory", "Howard: So, I was doing some checking on the ring.", "Raj: Hold on. Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?", "Sheldon: Yes, there is. Oh, here\u2019s a fun fact, ketchup started out as a general term for sauce, typically made of, uh, mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices. Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy, oyster, kidney bean and grape.", "Raj: No, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll get it.", "Howard: Listen, I was looking at the ring, and it seemed a little weird. No copyright notice on it. So, I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with, shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.", "Leonard: Seedy underbelly?", "Howard: You know, your black market phasers, your screen-worn Lieutenant Uhura panties, that kind of stuff.", "Raj: Who\u2019s this mysterious buddy you suddenly have?", "Howard: Just a guy. I know a guy.", "Raj: Is it Eddie Crispo?", "Howard: No, I can\u2019t tell you who it is. Stop asking.", "Raj: Who else could it be? It has to be Eddie Crispo.", "Howard: I know lots of dangerous people, okay?", "Raj: Name one.", "Howard: Eddie Crispo. Anyway, he said this isn\u2019t a replica. It\u2019s the real deal.", "Sheldon: If you\u2019re suggesting that that is the actual ring of power forged by Sauron in Mount Doom, I look at you with an expression of exhaustion and ever so slight amusement.", "Leonard: He\u2019s not saying it\u2019s a magic ring. You\u2019re not, are you?", "Howard: No, but it\u2019s close. Look at the markings inside. Those are production markings. Nine rings were made for use in the Lord of the Rings movies. Three were given to members of the cast. The rest were destroyed. Except one. One was stolen. Gentlemen, this is the one ring.", "Sheldon (snatching it): Mine!", "Leonard: No, it is not yours. We all went in on the box together.", "Sheldon: Well, yes, but I found it in the box, and the laws of maritime salvage clearly state that the finder of a sunken treasure is the owner of the treasure.", "Leonard: How is this maritime salvage?", "Sheldon: Other than the lack of water, how is it not?", "Raj: Wait, wait. Sheldon, stop being crazy for a second. How much is something like this worth?", "Howard: Well, it\u2019s tough to say since it\u2019s hot, but on the underground market, my guy figures\u2026", "Raj: Your guy Eddie Crispo?", "Howard: Yes. He figures ten, maybe 15 thousand.", "Raj: Okay, that\u2019s a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical. Like a jet ski.", "Howard: Why do you want a jet ski?", "Raj: All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis. That can\u2019t just be a coincidence.", "Sheldon: We can\u2019t sell it. We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and re-enact our favourite scenes from the movies.", "Howard: It\u2019s sad how great that sounds.", "Leonard: Guys, it\u2019s stolen. It should go back to Peter Jackson. He made the movies, it belongs to him.", "Howard: Fine. He can have it back as long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.", "Raj: There are no Jewish hobbits.", "Howard: Clearly, you\u2019ve never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.", "Leonard: We are not blackmailing Peter J\u2026 All right, where\u2019s the ring?", "Sheldon: You mean my ring?", "Leonard: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: The ring was unguarded, it was just sitting on the table, anyone could have taken it. Proof? I did.", "Leonard: Give me that.", "Raj: Look, let\u2019s be reasonable. We all want to do different things with the ring, but your ideas are stupid, and I want a jet ski.", "Sheldon: I found it. The ring is mine. I don\u2019t understand why in this group I never get my way.", "Leonard: You always get your way.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll stipulate to that if you give me the ring.", "Penny: Hey, guys. Enjoying your food that I actually brought you instead of promising food, but bringing you a box of random crap?", "Leonard: Yeah, it\u2019s delicious, the sarcasm\u2019s a little stale, though. Hey, how about this? Until we figure out what to do with the ring, Penny holds on to it.", "Penny: What ring?", "Leonard: This ring.", "Sheldon: Looking for something?", "Leonard: Will you hold on to this for a couple of days?", "Penny: Why?", "Leonard: It\u2019s a prop from a movie, and we\u2019re kind of fighting over it.", "Penny: Okay, just to be clear, the first piece of jewellery my boyfriend gives me is a prop from a movie, and I don\u2019t even get to keep it?", "Howard: If you had gone out with me three years ago, by now, you\u2019d have my great Aunt Ida\u2019s brooch that she smuggled out of occupied Belgium in a cat.", "Leonard: How am I looking now?", "Scene: Penny and Leonard are asleep in Leonard\u2019s bed. Sheldon creeps in and tries to take the ring from round Penny\u2019s neck, but she turns over. He tries to make buzzing fly noises to get her to turn back, but she turns all the way the other way. He then uses an extender with a claw on the end to lif the ring from Penny\u2019s chest. As he tries to remove it, she wakes up, screams, and punches him in the face.", "Sheldon: Ow! You hit me! I\u2019m bleeding!", "Leonard: What was that?", "Penny: Sheldon tried to take the ring and I punched him.", "Leonard: That\u2019s my girl.", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "\u00a0", "Howard: So, Sheldon, how\u2019s it feel to get beaten up by a girl?", "Sheldon:\u00a0 It\u2019s not the first time. I have a twin sister whose assaults began in utero. If only I\u2019d had the presence of mind to reabsorb her, then I\u2019d have a mole with hair in it instead of a tedious yearly Christmas letter.", "Raj: Gentlemen, have you come to the realization that the only reasonable course of action is to sell the ring and divide the money?", "Leonard: No.", "Raj: I was afraid of that. (Opens his laptop to reveal an Indian looking man on a webcam.) Go ahead.", "Man on Screen: Greetings from Mumbai. I am Raj\u2019s attorney, Venkatesh Koothrappali.", "Raj: Also my cousin.", "Howard: You brought a lawyer?", "Venkatesh: Don\u2019t answer that. I\u2019ll get straight to the point. My client\u2019s prepared to surrender any interest he has in the ring in exchange for two Kawasaki Jet Skis.", "Leonard: We\u2019re not giving him two Jet Skis.", "Venkatesh: Look, we\u2019re big boys, why don\u2019t we just cut to the chase and meet in the middle? One Kawasaki Jet Ski, done and done.", "Leonard: No Jet Skis.", "Venkatesh: All right, forget the Jet Skis.", "Raj: Forget the Jet Skis? That was our line in the sand! What happened to \u201ctear them a new one?\u201d", "Venkatesh: What can I say? They played hardball. We lost.", "Raj: You\u2019re useless.", "Venkatesh: I told you that when you hired me.", "Raj: I\u2019m signing off now.", "Venkatesh: Call your mother, she worries.", "Howard: Okay, just so you know, if we\u2019re bringing in cousins who are lawyers, prepare for shock and awe.", "Leonard: You know what? I am ending this. Penny didn\u2019t want to hold the ring anymore. She gave it to me, I have it. I\u2019m sending it back. Where\u2019s the ring?", "Sheldon: You mean this ring? Next time be aware of your surroundings while urinating in a public men\u2019s room.", "Leonard: Give me that.", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s mine.", "Raj: It\u2019s all of ours. (They begin to struggle over the ring.)", "Leonard: Okay, now, this is ridiculous!", "Howard: Then let go!", "Leonard: I\u2019m not letting go, you let go.", "Howard: I say this ring belongs to the last person who can hold on.", "Leonard: Fine. But can\u2019t we go home and start this?", "Raj: Sure. Let go of the ring.", "Leonard: All right, it starts now.", "Howard: You do realize there\u2019s a giant bug movie marathon tonight on the Syfy Channel. (They start to move away from the table while all still holding the ring.)", "Raj: Wait, my laptop. (They go back for it.)", "Scene: The stairwell. The guys are coming up the stairs, all still holding the ring.", "\u00a0", "Howard: You know, there\u2019s a point when this becomes idiotic.", "Leonard: And it wasn\u2019t when we were driving like this?", "Sheldon: I would advise the three of you that resistance is futile. I have endless patience. I once spent two-and-a-half hours on hold with Hewlett-Packard customer service just to complain about their customer service.", "Leonard: You want to talk about endless patience? Penny made me watch all five seasons of Sex and the City.", "Raj: There are six seasons, dude.", "Leonard: Oh, crap!", "Raj: No, no, no, the sixth season is great. We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken, and then Mr. Big shows up, we don\u2019t know if we can trust him again. It\u2019s a wild ride.", "Leonard: Door. (Leonard tries to unlock the door and drops the keys.)", "Raj: Okay, everybody, and plie. And relevae.", "Penny: Whatcha doin\u2019?", "Leonard: Last one holding the ring decides its fate. I know, it sounds silly.", "Penny: No, no, no, no, no, no, you are my boyfriend. Nothing you do is silly to me.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Penny: FYI, this is a bag from Victoria\u2019s Secret.", "Leonard: I\u2019m out.", "Scene: The apartment. The three guys are still holding the ring. Howard is on the phone. ", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry, Ma, I have to stay late at the office.", "Raj: No, he\u2019s doesn\u2019t! He\u2019s lying to you!", "Howard: Will you be quiet?", "Raj: Well, if you want privacy let go of the ring. I\u2019m so glad we came to this gentile strip club! Howard, here\u2019s more bacon to tuck into the shiksa\u2019s G-string!", "Howard: I\u2019ll call you back.", "Raj: I think it\u2019s lovely you call your mommy and let her know you\u2019re going to be late for dinner. From what I know about these things, if a woman doesn\u2019t breast-feed on time, it\u2019s very uncomfortable for her boobies.", "Howard: Don\u2019t you talk about my mother\u2019s boobies!", "Raj: If you\u2019re offended, let go of the ring and go on home to your mother\u2019s boobies.", "Sheldon: Excellent, excellent. Tire each other out, the ring will be mine. Howard, why don\u2019t you go after Raj\u2019s mother?", "Raj: Why don\u2019t we go after your mother?", "Sheldon: Go ahead. I have no illusions about my mother. She is a kind, loving, religiously fanatical right-wing Texan with a slightly out-of-scale head and a mild Dr. Pepper addiction. Anything you\u2019d like to add?", "Howard: That\u2019s not gonna Better pull out the big gun.", "Raj: You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s talk about your grandmother.", "Sheldon: No! I call no Meemaws.", "Raj: Think about this. The only way your mother was born was your Meemaw had sex.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t want to hear this.", "Howard: Then let go of the ring and walk away.", "Sheldon: Never.", "Howard: All right. I\u2019ll bet your Meemaw didn\u2019t just have sex to have your mother. I bet she had sex because she liked it.", "Sheldon: Stop it!", "Raj: Yeah, Meemaw did the nasty.", "Sheldon: I said stop it!", "Howard: We\u2019re getting to him.", "Sheldon: Waterfalls!", "Raj: What?", "Sheldon: Waterfalls. Crashing waves. Babbling brooks.", "Howard: What are you doing?", "Sheldon: Subliminal messaging. I\u2019m going to make you want to pee. Dripping faucets. Leaky gutter. Peeing.", "Raj: It\u2019s, it\u2019s not working, dude.", "Sheldon: Oh-ho-ho, it\u2019s working all right. I have to pee.", "Raj: Then let go of the ring and go.", "Howard: No, actually, I wouldn\u2019t mind going, too.", "Raj: Fine. Um, on the count of three. One, two\u2026", "Sheldon: Wait, just to clarify. When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?", "Howard: We stand up.", "Sheldon: Excellent choice.", "Raj: Three.", "Howard: Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.", "Scene: Sometime later. The guys are on the settee. Howard is seen asleep, he is not holding the ring. The camera pans along to where Sheldon and Raj still hold the ring. Raj, also asleep, lets go and cuddles up to Howard. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve done it! I\u2019ve won! The ring is mine! It\u2019s mine! (He runs to the bathroom) We\u2019re going to clean it up and make it pretty. My own. My love. My precious. (He looks in the mirror and has turned into golem. He screams and wakes up, still on the settee.) Where\u2019s the ring?", "Leonard: It\u2019s in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.", "Raj: The fires of Mount Doom?", "Leonard: Peter Jackson\u2019s office in New Zealand. It wasn\u2019t ours.", "Howard: You quit the game! You had no right to take it.", "Leonard: I came in here, you guys were all sleeping. The ring was on the floor. No one was touching it.", "Raj: Well, so then we start the game over until there\u2019s a winner.", "Leonard: There wasn\u2019t ever going to be a winner. There was going to be a selfish, petty person with a ring and three people who used to be his friend. Is that really what you guys want? \u2018Cause if it is, fine, I don\u2019t want anything to do with you. And I don\u2019t know what happened in that bathroom, but I am not cleaning it up! (Goes to his bedroom. Takes a box from under his bed. Takes out the ring.) My precious.", "Scene: Leonard and Penny are asleep in Leonard\u2019s bed. The extender and claw reaches across and pulls down the sheet revealing the ring on a chain round Leonard\u2019s neck.", "Sheldon: I knew it. Give us the precious!", "Leonard: NEVER!", "(They begin to struggle, both shouting \u201cgive it\u201d, \u201cgive it to me\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s mine\u201d at various intervals. Penny gets out of the bed and heads out the door.)", "Penny: Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym."]}
