{"series": "3", "episode": "15", "transcript": ["Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Howard (on the phone): Yeah, I miss you, too, sweetie. Listen, I got to go, but I\u2019ll see you tonight? Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye. No, you hang up first. Hello?", "Raj: Dude, I\u2019m glad you finally got a girlfriend, but do you have to do all that lovey-dovey stuff in front of those of us who don\u2019t?", "Sheldon: Actually, he might have to. There\u2019s an economic concept known as a positional good in which an object is only valued by the possessor because it\u2019s not possessed by others. The term was coined in 1976 by economist Fred Hirsch to replace the more colloquial, but less precise neener-neener.", "Howard: That\u2019s not true. My happiness is not dependent on my best friend being miserable and alone.", "Raj: Thank you.", "Howard: Although, I\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t a little bit of a perk.", "Leonard: Who\u2019s miserable and alone?", "Raj: Me.", "Leonard: Oh. I used to be like that. Then I got a girlfriend.", "Sheldon: In pre-1976 terms, neener-neener.", "Leonard: Hey, what are you and Bernadette doing for your first Valentine\u2019s Day?", "Howard: Yeah, I am pulling out all the stops. There\u2019s a $39.95 lover\u2019s special at P.F. Chang\u2019s. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front.", "Sheldon: Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn\u2019t a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one\u2019s steady gal to witness a brutal murder?", "Howard: I understand your point, but given a choice, Jews always go with Chinese food.", "Raj: Well, if anyone\u2019s interested, I\u2019ll be spending this Valentine\u2019s Day the same way I spend every Valentine\u2019s Day. Buying a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, taking it home, standing over the sink and eating it out of the package with my bare hands like an animal.", "Leonard: Okay, so to sum up: one giant marble horse, one asinine comment, one lonely man and his chicken. And let\u2019s see, who\u2019s left? Oh, that\u2019s right. My plans. Isn\u2019t anyone going to ask?", "Raj: Fine, tell us you\u2019re going to have sex with Penny.", "Leonard: That\u2019s not what I was going to tell you.", "Raj: It\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind hearing about your sex life. It\u2019s his that bugs me.", "Leonard: Guess who the university is sending to Switzerland to attend a conference and see the CERN supercollider on February 14?", "Sheldon: Professor Norton, although, God knows why. He hasn\u2019t published anything of note since he won that Nobel Prize.", "Leonard: Actually, Professor Norton can\u2019t make it. He threw his back out rock climbing.", "Howard: I heard he threw his back out climbing on his new girlfriend.", "Raj: The big-boobed weather girl on Channel 2?", "Howard: That\u2019s the one.", "Leonard: In any case, they\u2019re asking me to fill in for him.", "Sheldon: In Switzerland or with the big-boobed weather girl?", "Leonard: Switzerland. And I get to bring a guest!", "Howard: Oh, man!", "Raj: No way, dude!", "Sheldon: This is incredible! I\u2019m so happy, I\u2019m not even going to question their judgment in picking you. I\u2019m just going to run home and start packing.", "Raj: Why wouldn\u2019t you take Penny?", "Leonard: I am taking Penny.", "Raj: Oh. Well, then I anticipate an awkward situation when you get home.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, you got a minute?", "Sheldon: Of course, my good friend. Come in. Help me out, which ski hat says apr\u00e8s supercollider?", "Leonard: Sheldon, I\u2019m not taking you to Switzerland.", "Sheldon: Well, of course you are. Who else would you take?", "Leonard: Penny.", "Sheldon: What? That\u2019s absurd. Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.", "Leonard: Yes, but it\u2019ll be Valentine\u2019s Day. We can go sightseeing and skiing and make love in front of a roaring fire in the shadow of the snowcapped Alps.", "Sheldon: But Penny has no interest in subatomic particle research.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Sorry? I\u2019ve been dreaming about going to the Large Hadron Collider since I was nine years old.", "Leonard: Yeah, well, I\u2019ve been dreaming about spending Valentine\u2019s Day with a girl since I was six.", "Sheldon: Shame on you! That\u2019s no dream for a scientist!", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Okay, what\u2019s the big surprise?", "Leonard: Just a minute. This tray contains clues as to what you and I are going to be doing on Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Penny: Oh. Wow. Okay. Let\u2019s see. We\u2019ve got, uh, milk chocolate, Swiss cheese, fondue. My lactose-intolerant boyfriend is going to eat all this, then I\u2019m going to climb on his back and rocket to the moon?", "Leonard: No. But it does involve air travel. Okay, um, let me slice this Swiss cheese with my Swiss army knife, and then you can wash it down with a cup of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.", "Penny: Okay, I\u2019m starting to think Swiss is key here.", "Leonard: Uh-huh.", "Penny: We\u2019re going to Disneyland and ride the Matterhorn?", "Leonard: How does that involve air travel?", "Penny: We\u2019re going to Disney World and ride the Matterhorn?", "Leonard: No.", "Penny: Okay, sweetie, this started out fun, but I\u2019m over it.", "Leonard: We\u2019re going to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider! And ski. We\u2019ll also go skiing.", "Penny: We\u2019re going skiing in Switzerland?!", "Leonard: Well, you\u2019ll ski, I\u2019ll fall, but, yeah, we will be in Switzerland for Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Penny: Oh, my God, Leonard! That\u2019s incredible!", "Sheldon: Not so fast. You might want to hold off on lighting your rabeliechtli, Penny.", "Penny: My Rabe-what-ly?", "Sheldon: Rabeliechtli. It means turnip light and refers to a traditional lantern hand-carved from a root vegetable and used to celebrate certain Swiss festivals. Which you will not be celebrating because, A, these festivals occur in the fall, and B, you will not be going to Switzerland.", "Leonard: Sheldon, we\u2019ve been through this. I\u2019m taking Penny.", "Sheldon: Afraid not. Do you recognize this?", "Leonard: Not the roommate agreement.", "Sheldon: Indeed, the roommate agreement. I call your attention to the Friendship Rider in Appendix C, Future Commitments. Number 37, in the event one friend is ever invited to visit the Large Hadron Collider, now under construction in Switzerland, he shall invite the other friend to accompany him.", "Leonard: Oh, for God\u2019s sakes.", "Penny: You actually put that in an agreement?", "Leonard: Yeah. We also put in what happens if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant, or if one of us gets superpowers, or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.", "Sheldon: He can\u2019t kill me, even if I turn.", "Penny: Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?", "Sheldon: No, that seemed a little farfetched.", "Leonard: Sheldon, do you really expect to enforce this?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve lived up to all my commitments under the agreement. At least once a day I ask how you are, even though I simply don\u2019t care. I no longer stage spontaneous biohazard drills after 10 pm And I abandoned my goal to master Tuvan throat singing.", "Penny: Okay, I know I shouldn\u2019t ask, but what is\u2026?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon (after demonstrating): I\u2019d be much further along if I\u2019d been allowed to practice.", "Leonard: Look, Sheldon, I know it\u2019s in the agreement, and if you turn into a zombie, I promise I will not kill you. In fact, I\u2019ll even let you eat my brains. But I am taking Penny to Switzerland.", "Sheldon: Is that your final decision?", "Leonard: It is.", "Sheldon: Very well.", "Penny: It\u2019s not over, is it?", "Leonard: What do you think? (The sound of Tuvan throat singing comes from Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.)", "\u00a0", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Leonard: Got a bit of traffic this morning, huh? Think it\u2019s gonna rain? Instead of underpants, I covered my crotch with potato salad this morning. Thoughts? Okay, I know what\u2019ll cheer you up, let\u2019s play one of your driving games.", "Sheldon: All right. This game is called Traitors. I will name three historical figures, you put them in order of the heinousness of their betrayal. Benedict Arnold, Judas, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.", "Leonard: You really think I belong with Benedict Arnold and Judas?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right. Judas had the decency to hang himself after what he did.", "Leonard: Come on, Sheldon. Can\u2019t you at least try to understand how much this means to me?", "Sheldon: Round two, Leonard Hofstadter, Darth Vader, Rupert Murdoch.", "Leonard: Rupert Murdoch?", "Sheldon: He owns Fox, and they cancelled Firefly. Hint, he and Darth Vader are tied for number 2.", "Scene: The university cafeteria. ", "Howard: I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t hang with you last night. I had a date with Bernadette.", "Raj: I know. I saw the Tweet.", "Howard: So, what did you end up doing?", "Raj: Not much. Nuked a burrito. Prayed to the Hindu god Urvashi that your bowels would loosen and your penis would droop like a willow tree.", "Leonard: You seen Sheldon?", "Raj: No. Is he still mad about the supercollider?", "Leonard: Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him. I mean, come on, what would you guys do if you were me?", "Howard: I\u2019d take Sheldon to Switzerland.", "Leonard: Seriously?", "Howard: Absolutely. And I\u2019d leave him there. (Sheldon enters, puts a tray in front of Leonard, and exits.)", "Raj: What the hell is that?", "Leonard: Uh, let\u2019s see. Yup, 30 pieces of silverware.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: Morning, old chum.", "Leonard: What\u2019s going on?", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve made you breakfast. Juice, coffee, and pancakes in the shape of some of your favorite fictional characters. See, here\u2019s Frodo.", "Leonard: You made Frodo pancakes?", "Sheldon: Yeah, I used coconut shavings to do the hair on his feet. If you need to void your bladder before eating, I can keep them warm with this beret that I thoroughly laundered and pressed into service as a pancake cosy.", "Leonard: Why are you doing this?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s by way of an apology for my recent behaviour. I\u2019ve had some time to reflect and I\u2019ve come to realize that friendship is not an aggregation of written agreements. It\u2019s a result of two people respecting and caring for each other. Butterscotch scone?", "Leonard: Thanks. It\u2019s good.", "Sheldon: What you\u2019re tasting is respect and affection. And about a pound of Crisco. After you\u2019ve finished breakfast, I thought we could spend the day watching the final season of Babylon 5 with director commentary.", "Leonard: You hate Babylon 5.", "Sheldon: I do. It fails as drama, science fiction, and it\u2019s hopelessly derivative. But you like it, and you\u2019re my friend.", "Leonard: Okay, great. Still not taking you to Switzerland.", "Sheldon: Drat. No Frodo for you.", "Scene: The laundry room.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: Hello.", "Sheldon: Alright, let\u2019s dispense with the friendly banter, I believe you know why I\u2019m here.", "Penny: Well, I always figured it was to study us, discover our weaknesses, and report back to your alien overlords.", "Sheldon: Yes, amusing. Extraordinary intelligence might well appear extraterrestrial to you, but let me be more specific. I believe you know why I\u2019m here in the laundry room.", "Penny: Better acoustics for your throat singing?", "Sheldon (trying it): It\u2019s actually not bad. But my true purpose in being here will be revealed in this brief PowerPoint presentation. Lights. Why Sheldon Cooper, PhD, should go to Switzerland to see the CERN supercollider. A PowerPoint presentation by Sheldon Cooper, PhD.", "Penny: Oh, for God\u2019s sakes.", "Sheldon: Here we have a highly gifted researcher in the field of particle physics whose work has brought him to the precipice of forever changing mankind\u2019s understanding of the universe. AKA me. And here we have a waitress brushing her teeth with her finger. AKA you.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry. Is this supposed to be buttering me up?", "Sheldon: Please hold all questions to the end of the presentation. This is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, the product of decades of planning and construction. It is a Mecca for physicists the world over. This is Bath and Body Works on Colorado Boulevard. They sell scented soaps and lotions, some of which contain glitter. Now, let\u2019s see if we can match the individual to the appropriate destination.", "Penny: Okay, show\u2019s over.", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s not. I\u2019ve got five more slides.", "Penny: Sheldon, this is Leonard\u2019s decision. He invited me to Switzerland, and I intend to go.", "Sheldon: Very well. Enjoy yourself. You\u2019re going to be in the presence of something that I\u2019ve dreamed of seeing for decades. I just hope you\u2019ll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.", "Penny: I\u2019ll talk to Leonard.", "Sheldon: You will?", "Penny: Yes. If it means that much to you, you should go.", "Sheldon (Hugging her): Oh, Penny, thank you!", "Penny: You\u2019re welcome.", "Sheldon: Since I rarely hug, I\u2019m relying on your expertise regarding duration.", "Penny: I think we\u2019re there.", "Sheldon: Oh, good. Bye-bye.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: You know what? Even though I don\u2019t have a girlfriend, I can still have a good time on Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Howard: Trust me, you can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried.", "Raj: No, no, no, I\u2019m going to have a me day. First I\u2019m going to go to one of those spas in Koreatown, take a steam and get a massage. Then I\u2019m going to stop at a pet store and get licked by puppies.", "Leonard: Sheldon, I need to talk to you.", "Sheldon: All right, my friend. Would you like some cholermus?", "Leonard: Some what?", "Sheldon: Cholermus. It\u2019s a traditional Swiss breakfast dish. I\u2019m preparing my gastrointestinal system for the exotic cuisine of Switzerland.", "Leonard: You\u2019re not going to Switzerland!", "Sheldon: Oh, but I am. Didn\u2019t Penny tell you the good news?", "Leonard: She told me that you went behind my back to guilt her into letting you go instead of her.", "Sheldon: Yes, that good news.", "Leonard: Well, forget it. I was the one who was invited, I get to decide who goes with me, and it\u2019s Penny, not you!", "Sheldon: Howard, could you lower the lights? I have a short PowerPoint presentation.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t need to see your presentation. This discussion is over!", "Sheldon: That\u2019s a somewhat ambiguous response. Am I going or not?", "Leonard: Sheldon, at this point, I would go by myself before I would take you.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Leonard: Yeah, really.", "Sheldon: Well then, you leave me no alternative. From this moment forward, we can be roommates, but we will no longer be friends.", "Leonard: I\u2019m sorry you feel that way.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re fully aware of the ramifications here, Leonard.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t you enlighten me?", "Sheldon: With the friendship clause of our roommate agreement nullified you are no longer entitled to accompany me to go swimming at Bill Gates\u2019 house should I be invited.", "Howard: Ooh, that\u2019s gotta sting.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Leonard: Just think, this time tomorrow we\u2019ll be in Geneva, Switzerland for our first Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Penny: I know! I went shopping today and bought special undies for the occasion.", "Leonard: Thermal? \u2018Cause it\u2019s gonna be cold.", "Penny: Think it through, Leonard.", "Leonard: Oh!", "Penny: Oh!", "Leonard (Penny sneezes): Gesundheit. Or as they say in Switzerland, gesundheit. You getting a cold?", "Penny: No, no, it\u2019s probably just allergies.", "Leonard: Do you want an allergy pill? \u2018Cause I have \u2019em all. Prescription, nonprescription, foreign, domestic, experimental.", "Penny: Do any of them work?", "Leonard: Not really, I\u2019m just an enthusiast.", "(Time passes. Sound of Penny retching in the bathroom)", "Leonard: Penny? You okay?", "Penny: Did that sound okay to you? Do not come in here!", "Leonard: What\u2019s going on?", "Penny: I\u2019m having a tea party. What do you think\u2019s going on? I think I might have the flu. Or the plague.", "Leonard: Well, our plane leaves at 9 a.m. Do you think you\u2019ll feel better by then?", "Penny: Yep. \u2018Cause I\u2019m gonna be dead.", "Scene: Outside Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Leonard: Hey, Sheldon? Listen, Penny is pretty sick and she\u2019s not going to be able to go to Switzerland. So if you\u2019re still interested, you\u2019re welcome to come. (Sound of Sheldon vomiting in the bathroom)", "Sheldon: Great. I\u2019ll start packing. In a minute. (Vomits again) Oh, look, it\u2019s the cholermus.", "Scene: The apartment.", "\u00a0", "Penny: Here\u2019s your soup.", "Sheldon: Chicken?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: With the little stars?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Heated to 180 degrees?", "Penny: Why don\u2019t I pour it in your lap, and you can tell me.", "Sheldon: You don\u2019t have to be mean. I\u2019m sick.", "Penny: Yeah, well, I\u2019m sick, too.", "Sheldon: Not my problem. I just don\u2019t understand how this happened to me. I\u2019m scrupulous about my hygiene. I regularly disinfect my hands, and I avoid contact with other people on general principle.", "Penny: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Sheldon.", "Sheldon (remembering the hug): It\u2019s you! I touched you!", "Penny: Happy Valentine\u2019s Day.", "Scene: A Swiss hotel room. ", "Raj: Oh, my goodness, look at this room! Champagne! Roses! Oh, and little chocolates! This is going to be the best Valentine\u2019s Day ever.", "Leonard: Yeah, I forgot about all this.", "Raj: But I never will."]}
