{"series": "3", "episode": "23", "transcript": ["Scene: On the roof of the apartment building.", "Leonard: Okay, we\u2019ve got power to the laser.", "Sheldon: I should\u2019ve brought an umbrella.", "Leonard: What for? It\u2019s not going to rain.", "Sheldon: I know that, but with skin as fair as mine, moon burn is a real possibility.", "Howard: That\u2019s a bazinga, right?", "Sheldon: One of my best, don\u2019t you think?", "Leonard: Howard, do you want to double-check the equatorial mount on the laser? We need it locked onto the Sea of Tranquility.", "Howard: You got it. Oh, Raj, no. Billions of dollars have gone into inventing the Internet and filling it with pictures of naked women, so we don\u2019t have to peep through windows.", "Raj: It\u2019s not like that, I\u2019m watching someone\u2019s TV. The Good Wife is on. I tell you, this is my new Grey\u2019s Anatomy.", "Sheldon: Leonard, Leonard. What is that? What is that?", "Leonard: Relax, it\u2019s just a dirty sock.", "Sheldon: How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?", "Leonard: Sheldon, the world is filled with dirty discarded socks.", "Sheldon: Not my world.", "Leonard: Hey, you know who\u2019d really dig seeing this experiment? Penny.", "Sheldon: I wasn\u2019t aware that lunar ranging was her thing. Although, I suppose the retro-reflector left on the moon by Neil Armstrong does qualify as a shiny object.", "Raj: Why don\u2019t you ask her to come up?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s still a little weird since, you know\u2026", "Howard: She dumped you?", "Leonard: She didn\u2019t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.", "Sheldon: I fail to see how a relationship can have the qualities of a geographic location.", "Howard: Oh, it\u2019s very simple. Leonard was living in a little town called please don\u2019t leave me, while Penny had just moved to the island of bye-bye.", "Leonard: Screw you guys. I\u2019m gonna go see if she\u2019s home.", "Howard: If it\u2019s not too much trouble, I\u2019d like to point this at the moon now.", "Raj: Wait a second, the good wife is crying. Something\u2019s very wrong.", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s door.", "Penny: Oh, hi. What\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: We\u2019re up on the roof bouncing laser beams off the moon.", "Penny: I\u2019m sorry, what?", "Leonard: It\u2019s pretty cool. We\u2019ve got a two-meter parabolic reflector and everything. I thought you might want to see it.", "Man in Penny\u2019s Apartment: That makes no sense.", "Penny: Um\u2026", "Man: How can you bounce stuff off the moon? There\u2019s no gravity.", "Penny: Uh, Leonard, this is Zack. Zack, Leonard.", "Zack: Hey.", "Leonard: Oh, sorry, I didn\u2019t know you were busy. Maybe another time.", "Penny: Yeah, maybe.", "Zack: Hey, I want to see this laser thing.", "Penny: Oh, but what about the party?", "Zack: It\u2019s a surprise party, doesn\u2019t matter when we get there.", "Penny: Oh, right.", "Leonard: Okay, well, yeah, come on up. So, how\u2019d you two guys meet?", "Zack: My company designs the menus for the Cheesecake Factory.", "Leonard: Your company?", "Zack: Well,, my dad, but me and my sister are VPs.", "Leonard: So, menus.", "Zack: I know it sounds easy but there\u2019s a lot of science that goes in designing them.", "Scene: The roof.", "Howard: Happy now? I\u2019m moving the dirty sock.", "Sheldon: Thank you. Raj, keep an eye out for the other one.", "Penny: Hey, guys, this is my friend Zack.", "Zack: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Zack: Whoa! Is that the laser? It\u2019s bitchin\u2019.", "Sheldon: Yes. In 1917, when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, his fondest hope was that the resultant device be bitchin\u2019.", "Zack: Well, mission accomplished.", "Leonard: Let me explain what we\u2019re doing here. Um, in 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the surface of the moon, and we\u2019re going to shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.", "Penny: Oh! That\u2019s very cool.", "Zack: One question. How can you be sure it won\u2019t blow up?", "Leonard: The laser?", "Zack: The moon.", "Sheldon: See, now this is a man for Penny.", "Leonard: Uh, that\u2019s a great question, Zack.", "Sheldon: No, it\u2019s not.", "Penny: Sheldon! Play nice.", "Sheldon: Well it\u2019s not a great question. How could somebody possibly think we\u2019re going to blow up the moon? That\u2019s a great question.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry about the moon. We, we set our laser to stun.", "Zack: Smart.", "Leonard: Now, we\u2019ll be able to see the beam when it leaves, but it won\u2019t be strong enough when it comes back to be seen by the naked eye.", "Zack: Naked.", "Leonard: Right. Uh yeah, funny. Uh, that device there will measure the photons that return and let us see it on this computer. Raj, get them some glasses.", "Zack: Cool, it\u2019s gonna be in 3-D?", "Howard: Preparing to fire laser at the moon.", "Sheldon: Make it so.", "Howard: There it is. There\u2019s the spike!", "Leonard: 2.5 seconds for the light to return. That\u2019s the moon! We hit the moon!", "Zack: That\u2019s your big experiment? All that for a line on the screen?", "Leonard: Yeah, but, uh, think about what this represents. The fact that we can do this is the only way of definitively proving that there are man-made objects on the moon, put there by a member of a species that only 60 years before had just invented the airplane.", "Zack: What species is that?", "Sheldon: I was wrong. Penny can do better.", "Penny: Okay, guys, thank you, it\u2019s been fun.", "Zack: Yeah, thanks. Should we invite them to the party?", "Penny: No, just keep walking.", "Sheldon: He must be very skilled at coitus.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: I\u2019m telling you, dude, the only way to feel better about Penny going out with other guys is for you to get back on the whores.", "Howard: Horse.", "Raj: What?", "Howard: The phrase is get back on the horse, not whores.", "Raj: That\u2019s disgusting, dude.", "Howard: No, it\u2019s not\u2026 Never mind. He is right, though. If you want, I can turn you on to this great new dating site I found.", "Leonard: No, thanks.", "Howard: You sure? They say they can find a match for anybody.", "Leonard: Have they found a match for you?", "Howard: Tons. I\u2019ve had, like, eight dates in the last month. And twelve if you count the ones who showed up and left.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t bring the nitrogen tank down.", "Leonard: Why not?", "Sheldon: All right, let me restate that. It\u2019s very heavy, and I don\u2019t want to.", "Leonard: I\u2019ll help you.", "Sheldon: Thank you. Lift with your knees, not your back. Good night.", "Raj: You know what would be fun? Signing Sheldon up for online dating.", "Howard: Yeah, right.", "Raj: No, think about it. We make it an experiment. Like when Frankenstein\u2019s monster was lonely and he found a wife.", "Howard: He didn\u2019t find a wife. They built him a wife out of dead body parts.", "Raj: Okay, we\u2019ll call that plan B.", "Scene: The apartment. It is night and the lights are off. Knocking.", "Leonard: Coming!", "Penny: Damn you, you rat bastard.", "Leonard: Are you drunk?", "Penny: Zack was a perfectly nice guy, and then you ruined him!", "Leonard: How did I ruin him?", "Penny: \u2018Cause in the olden days, I never would\u2019ve known he was so stupid.", "Leonard: Come on, he wasn\u2019t that stupid.", "Penny: Yes, he was! He thought you were gonna blow up the moon!", "Leonard: Okay, yeah, he\u2019s stupid.", "Penny: He spent the entire night bragging about how he invented the word appe-teasers.", "Leonard: How is that my fault?", "Penny: You have destroyed my ability to tolerate idiots. Now, come with me.", "Leonard: Where are we going?", "Penny: We\u2019re gonna have sex.", "Leonard: Why? I mean, okay.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s going on?", "Penny: Put on your noise-cancelling headphones, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna get loud.", "Sheldon: Oh! Not this again.", "Scene: The next morning.", "Sheldon: In what universe is this low-pulp? Good morning, Penny.", "Penny: What, do you have eyes in the back of your head?", "Sheldon: When one gets beaten up every other day in school, one of necessity develops a keen sense of hearing. Incidentally, one can get beaten up in school simply by referring to oneself as one. I\u2019m making English muffins. Would you like an English muffin?", "Penny: Oh, thanks, I\u2019m not hungry.", "Sheldon: FYI, my noise-cancelling headphones proved ineffective last night.", "Penny: Yeah, sorry about that.", "Sheldon: As a native Texan, I must say I\u2019ve never heard the phrase yee-haw used in quite that context.", "Penny: Oh, God.", "Sheldon: Oh, God. That I\u2019ve heard on multiple occasions. In what universe is that lightly toasted? This has to be the worst day of my life. Good morning, Leonard.", "Leonard: How many times have I asked you not to do that?", "Sheldon: Counting this instance? 317.", "Leonard: Where\u2019s Penny?", "Sheldon: She returned to her apartment. I presume to shower and vomit. Not necessarily in that order.", "Leonard: I wonder why she didn\u2019t say good-bye.", "Sheldon: Are you expecting me to offer an explanation of human behaviour?", "Leonard: I know. I just thought as an outsider, you might be able to provide a fresh perspective.", "Sheldon: I have no difficulty believing you\u2019re not butter.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s door.", "Leonard: Oh, hey.", "Penny: Oh, hi. Um, I gotta run. Early shift.", "Leonard: Okay, I\u2019ll walk down with you. So, last night was fun, huh?", "Penny: Yeah, it must have been. I just threw up in my closet.", "Leonard: Bummer. Anyway, I was thinking tonight maybe we could catch a movie.", "Penny: Oh, yeah, tonight\u2019s not great for me.", "Leonard: Doesn\u2019t have to be tonight. I\u2019m free pretty much always.", "Penny: Leonard, last night was a mistake.", "Leonard: When you say mistake, do you mean a fortunate mistake, like the discovery of penicillin?", "Penny: Look, I\u2019m sorry. I was drunk, I was lonely, I hated Zack. Can we just forget it ever happened?", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s pretty well imprinted on my brain. Especially the whole rodeo thing.", "Penny: Oh, God!", "Leonard: So, that\u2019s it? Wham, bam, thank you, Leonard?", "Penny: Look, I said I\u2019m sorry. Can\u2019t u please let it go?", "Leonard: How am I supposed to let it go? You used me for sex! Morning, Mrs. Gunderson.", "Mrs Gunderson: Good morning, Leonard. Or should I say yee-haw?", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Holy crap.", "Howard: What?", "Raj: We finally have proof that aliens walk among us.", "Howard: Excuse me?", "Raj: The dating site matched a woman with Sheldon.", "Howard: You\u2019re kidding. An actual woman?", "Raj: Yeah, look. Breasts and everything.", "Howard: Trust me, breasts doesn\u2019t necessarily mean woman.", "Raj: Since when?", "Howard: I\u2019ll show you a picture of my Uncle Louie in a bathing suit sometime. Leonard, you gotta see this, we found a match for Sheldon.", "Leonard: Great. Maybe she can have sex with him, and then walk out on him the next morning without so much as a how do you do?", "Raj: Do you know what he\u2019s talking about?", "Howard: Nope. Why don\u2019t you ask him?", "Raj: Leonard, what are you talking about?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to talk about it.", "Raj: That was a lousy suggestion.", "Howard: Whatever. Right now, Dr. Sheldon Cooper has to send an e-mail to his perfect match. Greetings, fellow life-form\u2026", "Scene: A building corridor.", "Leonard: If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. If she can do it, I can do it. (Knocks on door) I can\u2019t do it.", "Leslie Winkle: Hello?", "Leonard: Oh, hi. Hey. Hi, Leslie.", "Leslie: Leonard Hofstadter. What\u2019re you doing here?", "Leonard: Uh, I know! It\u2019s been a while!", "Leslie: Yeah, 18 months.", "Leonard: Right. Right. So how you doing?", "Leslie: Fine. You?", "Leonard: Uh, not bad. You remember when we used to have sex and you said that it didn\u2019t mean anything, it was just for fun?", "Leslie: Yeah.", "Leonard: Uh, do you, uh, want to do that again?", "Leslie: What happened? Blondie dumped you?", "Leonard: She didn\u2019t dump me. We were just in different places in the relationship.", "Leslie: Right.", "Leonard: Um, anyway, apparently, it\u2019s okay to go back to people you\u2019re no longer seeing and have recreational sex with them.", "Leslie: Uh-huh.", "Leonard: So, what do you say?", "Leslie: Let me think about it. (Slams door.)", "Leonard: She\u2019s not coming back.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Uh-oh. She wants to meet us.", "Howard: Not us. Him.", "Raj: Yes, but him doesn\u2019t even know about her.", "Howard: Well, him about to find out about her.", "Raj: Really? Us gonna tell him?", "Sheldon: Who\u2019s going to tell whom about what?", "Howard: Sheldon. Hey.", "Raj: Hi.", "Sheldon: Your surprise confuses me. I live here.", "Howard: Right. So, listen, what are you doing tomorrow afternoon?", "Sheldon: Be more specific.", "Howard: Four thirty.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s not afternoon. That\u2019s preevning.", "Howard: What?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a time of day I invented. It better defines the ambiguous period between afternoon and evening. Preevning. I\u2019m fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need.", "Raj: Right, okay. What are you doing tomorrow preevning?", "Sheldon: Well, tomorrow\u2019s Saturday. Saturday night is laundry night, so I\u2019ll be spending the preevning pre-sorting and pre-soaking.", "Howard: Okay, what if I were to tell you, tomorrow, at 4:30 you could meet a woman who has been scientifically chosen to be your perfect mate?", "Sheldon: I would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air, exhausted by your constant tomfoolery.", "Raj: But it\u2019s true. But we-we put all your vital information into this dating site, answered all their questions just like you would, and they found a match for you. Her name is Amy Farrah Fowler.", "Sheldon: Please. Even assuming you could answer any question the way I would, the algorithms used by matchmaking sites are complete hokum.", "Howard: And that\u2019s exactly the answer we gave to the question, what is your attitude towards online dating\u201d", "Raj: Howard wanted to write mumbo jumbo, but I said no, our Sheldon would say hokum.", "Howard: Well, come on, where\u2019s your scientific curiosity?", "Sheldon: Well, most of it is being applied to unravelling the secrets of the universe while the rest of it\u2019s wondering why I\u2019m having this conversation with you.", "Raj: Okay, how about this. Even Spock had a date once every seven years.", "Sheldon: He didn\u2019t date. It was pon farr. His blood boiled with mating lust.", "Howard: Okay, well, why don\u2019t you start with a cup of coffee, and you can pon farr Amy Farrah Fowler later.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t drink coffee.", "Howard: All right, you can have a hot chocolate.", "Sheldon: As I will not be engaging in this nonsense, my choice of beverage is moot. But for the record, I only drink hot chocolate in months with an R in them.", "Howard: Why?", "Sheldon: What\u2019s life without whimsy?", "Howard: Okay, I\u2019m out.", "Raj: Sheldon, I\u2019ve hidden the dirty sock from the roof somewhere in your apartment. Unless you are willing to come with us to meet this girl, it will remain there forever.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re bluffing.", "Raj: Are you willing to risk it?", "Sheldon: Curse you.", "Scene: The hallway. Leonard is finishing off a bottle of spirits. He opens the lift and drops the bottle inside.", "Leonard: Thirty feet.", "Penny: Oh. Hey, Leonard.", "Leonard: I was a perfectly happy, geeky, little lonely guy, and you ruined me!", "Penny: Are you drunk?", "Leonard: Come on. We\u2019re gonna have sex, and it\u2019s not gonna mean a thing!", "Penny: Are you out of your mind?!", "Leonard: I\u2019m really starting to think there\u2019s a double standard here.", "Scene: A coffee shop.", "Sheldon: In a few minutes, when I gloat over the failure of this enterprise, how would you prefer I do it? The standard I told you so? The classic neener-neener? Or just my normal look of haughty derision?", "Raj: You don\u2019t know we\u2019re wrong yet.", "Sheldon: Haughty derision it is.", "Amy: Excuse me. I\u2019m Amy Farrah Fowler. You\u2019re Sheldon Cooper.", "Sheldon: Hello, Amy Farrah Fowler. I\u2019m sorry to inform you that you have been taken in by unsupportable mathematics designed to prey on the gullible and the lonely. Additionally, I\u2019m being blackmailed with a hidden dirty sock.", "Amy: If that was slang, I\u2019m unfamiliar with it. If it was literal, I share your aversion to soiled hosiery. In any case, I\u2019m here because my mother and I have agreed that I will date at least once a year.", "Sheldon: Interesting. My mother and I have the same agreement about church.", "Amy: I don\u2019t object to the concept of a deity, but I\u2019m baffled by the notion of one that takes attendance.", "Sheldon: Well, then you might want to avoid East Texas.", "Amy: Noted. Now, before this goes any further, you should know that all forms of physical contact up to and including coitus are off the table.", "Sheldon: May I buy you a beverage?", "Amy: Tepid water, please.", "Howard: Good God, what have we done?"]}
