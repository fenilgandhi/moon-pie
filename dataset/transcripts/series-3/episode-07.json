{"series": "3", "episode": "07", "transcript": ["Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe you made up your own game.", "Sheldon: Oh, Research Lab is more than a game. It\u2019s like the slogan says, the physics is theoretical, but the fun is real.", "Leonard: We must not be playing it right.", "Penny: All right, five. One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow, look at that, my Department of Defence research grant is renewed.", "Sheldon: Oh! Great roll! Now you can demolish your Soviet-style cyclotron and build the large Hadron Collider.", "Penny: Yay.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re a natural at this, Penny. And as the first beta testers, you two\u2019ll have quite the edge when we play with Wolowitz and Koothrappali on Sunday.", "Leonard: Oh, gee, Sheldon, I don\u2019t think we can play on Sunday.", "Sheldon: Why not?", "Leonard: Because of the reasons that Penny will now tell you. Penny?", "Penny: Actually, I have to pick up my friend Justin from the airport.", "Leonard: There you go, she has to pick up her friend Justin at the airport, aAnd I can\u2019t play \u2019cause I\u2019m going with her, right?", "Penny: Um, yeah, if you want. I mean, there may not be room. He\u2019s got a lot of stuff, like guitars and amplifiers.", "Leonard: Wait. What are you talking about?", "Penny: My friend, Justin.", "Sheldon: Pay attention, Leonard. That\u2019s why she can\u2019t play on Sunday.", "Leonard: Who is this Justin?", "Sheldon: Your turn, Leonard.", "Penny: I told you about him.", "Leonard: No, you didn\u2019t.", "Sheldon: Roll the dice, Leonard.", "Penny: Yeah, my friend from Omaha, plays the guitar. Anyway, he\u2019s coming to L.A. looking for some session work, so I told him he could just crash on my couch for a few weeks.", "Sheldon: Come on, Leonard, if you roll a six, Penny dies horribly in a nuclear meltdown. See what I mean when I say the fun is real?", "Leonard: Hang on. Some guy is going to be sleeping on your couch?", "Penny: He\u2019s not some guy. He\u2019s my friend.", "Leonard: So by friend, do you mean friend friend, gay friend, or ex boyfriend who you\u2019re now platonic with but still might have a thing for you friend\u201d?", "Penny: Well, he\u2019s definitely not gay.", "Leonard: Oh, a definitely not gay musician sleeping on my girlfriend\u2019s couch. Yippee.", "Penny: Okay, we went out a little bit, a long time ago, but we were never like going out.", "Leonard: Okay, not to be pedantic, but the last I checked went out was in fact the past tense of going out, which I think we all know is a popular euphemism for saw each other naked.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll just roll for you.", "Penny: Do you have a problem with Justin staying with me?", "Leonard: What was your first clue?", "Sheldon: Uh-oh! Industrial accident.", "Penny: You know what? Don\u2019t talk to me like I\u2019m an idiot.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not talking to you like you\u2019re an idiot! I\u2019m saying the whole idea is idiotic!", "Sheldon: You accidentally stare at a helium-argon laser. Lose one turn and a retina.", "Penny: How is that not talking to me like I\u2019m an idiot? It\u2019s my friend, it\u2019s my couch, and it\u2019s my freakin\u2019 life!", "Sheldon: It\u2019s also your roll.", "Leonard: You know what? It is your life. If you want to have some stupid guitarist stay on your couch, then fine. Why don\u2019t you just rent some bunk beds and invite The Black Eyed Peas?", "Penny: Hey, if I want to invite the entire line up of Lollapalooza to sleep in my apartment, I will, and it\u2019s none of your business!", "Leonard: Are you listening to yourself? Do you know how childish you sound right now?", "Penny: Oh, now I\u2019m a child? Well, at least I\u2019m not an idiot anymore!", "Leonard: The two aren\u2019t mutually exclusive!", "Penny: Oh, you are such a\u2026 (Sheldon has placed ice in the blender and turned it on) What the hell is he doing?", "Leonard: He\u2019s drowning us out. He doesn\u2019t like fighting.", "Penny: Sheldon, just stop, look, the fight is over. Oh, and FYI, you never even heard of The Black Eyed Peas until you met me!", "Leonard: I heard of \u2019em. Didn\u2019t know they were a band. Sheldon, she\u2019s gone. You can turn off the blender.", "Sheldon: Has your relationship reached its inevitable ugly end?", "Leonard: No, we just had a little spat.", "Sheldon: Look on the bright side. As the result of Penny\u2019s forfeit, you have become the world\u2019s first winner of Research Lab. Would you like a commemorative snow cone?", "Credits sequence", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s car.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t get how she can just announce that an old boyfriend is going to be sleeping on her couch.", "Sheldon: Hey, I thought of a game we can play in the car.", "Leonard: I don\u2019t want to play a game, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s called Scientists. Now, I will name three scientists, then you will put them in order of the size of their contribution to their respective fields. To make this game even more compelling, you must consider only the contribution of the man to the field, not the validity of the field itself. For example, Abu Musa Jabir ibn Hayn made a greater contribution to the discredited field of alchemy than Halbert Vanderplatt made to neurobiology. Okay, ready to have some fun?", "Leonard: An old boyfriend who\u2019s definitely not gay. That\u2019s what a guy likes to hear, definitely.", "Sheldon: All right, I\u2019ll start with an easy one, um, Isaac Newton, Madame Curie and Niels Bohr.", "Leonard: And then I say one little thing and I end up being the bad guy!", "Sheldon: Hint, Madame Curie had her husband to help her.", "Leonard: What am I supposed to say? Sure, Penny, I\u2019m cool with your old boyfriend sleeping in your apartment. Well, Leonard, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re cool or not because I\u2019m Penny and I\u2019m pretty and I can do whatever the hell I want! Oh, I get it! You think you\u2019re doing me a favour just by being in a relationship with me! No, no, Leonard! I\u2019m doing you a favour just by being in the same room as you!", "Sheldon: Leonard! Stop the car!", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t listen to the two of you fight anymore.", "Scene: Leaving the apartment.", "Sheldon: Come on, come on, we\u2019re late.", "Leonard: Calm down, we\u2019ll make the movie.", "Sheldon: I believe my alarm is appropriate, given the situation. The movie starts in 17 minutes, which means we\u2019ll need to make all the lights on Colorado Boulevard, plus skip the concession stand, and preshow urination.", "Raj: Oh, dude, I wish you had said something before I pounded that last Red Bull.", "Sheldon: Go, go, Power Rangers, go!", "Penny: Hey.", "Leonard: Hey. We\u2019re, uh, going to the movies.", "Sheldon: No, we\u2019re not. We\u2019re standing in the hallway, suffering through an awkward encounter.", "Leonard: Hang on. They\u2019re showing a new digital print of Time Bandits, you wouldn\u2019t want to come, would you?", "Penny: Not really, no.", "Sheldon: All right, invitation pointlessly offered, invitation declined as expected, everyone\u2019s civil, nobody\u2019s fighting. Have a nice evening.", "Leonard: Just give us a minute.", "Howard: Oh, take all the time you need.", "Leonard: So, are we going to talk about last night?", "Penny: Are you ready to apologize?", "Leonard: No.", "Penny: E-e-e-e-eh! Wrong answer, but thank you for playing.", "Leonard: Oh, come on. This is stupid.", "Penny: Oh, there it is again! You think I\u2019m stupid!", "Leonard: No, there\u2019s a difference between being stupid and acting stupid.", "Penny: Oh, yeah? well, there\u2019s a difference between being a jerk and being an ass!", "Leonard: No, there isn\u2019t! They\u2019re synonyms!", "Raj: Well, that was rather unpleasant.", "Howard: Yeah, I don\u2019t think I need my preshow urination anymore.", "Sheldon: Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look, we\u2019re going to be late for the movies.", "Scene: The comic book store.", "\u00a0", "Howard: Hey! Look! Amazing Spider-Man 183.", "Sheldon: Got it.", "Howard: Remember this one? Spider-Man loses a big fight and then his girlfriend breaks up with him. Want me to get it for you? It\u2019ll help take your mind off things.", "Stuart: Hey, guys. What\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: Oh, we need to kill a couple hours till the next showing of Time Bandits.", "Stuart: Oh, well, no problem. I was thinking of closing early and going home, but let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s just a slightly smaller lonely room filled with comic books.", "Leonard: Thanks, Stuart. Let me ask you something. Do you think it\u2019s okay for Penny to have an ex-boyfriend sleep on her couch?", "Howard: No, I mean, she\u2019s obviously way out of line.", "Leonard: Thank you!", "Howard: But if she dumps you, she\u2019ll have a new boyfriend by tomorrow morning and you\u2019ll have a new girlfriend when you figure out how to build one. So the only question is, how long until you fold?", "Leonard: I am not going to fold.", "Raj: Well, excuse me, I don\u2019t think Penny\u2019s out of line at all. You don\u2019t own her. It\u2019s like my girl, Beyonce says, if you like it, you shoulda put a ring on it.\u201d", "Howard: Come on. At the very least, when she found out Leonard was upset about it, she should\u2019ve backed off.", "Raj: You mean like when a guy\u2019s upset because his friend agreed to take a cooking class with him and then doesn\u2019t show up because he\u2019s doing a juice fast with his mother?", "Howard: I didn\u2019t know you were upset about that.", "Raj: Really! Did you miss all the subtle indicators, like me saying, Howard, I am upset.", "Howard: Okay, sorry.", "Raj: Maybe it means something different in this country. Back in India, it means you\u2019re upset with a guy named Howard!", "Howard: I said I\u2019m sorry.", "Raj: Sorry doesn\u2019t make up for the fact that I had to make chicken and rice with this vegan guy. Do you know what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice!", "Howard: Yeah, well, you think I was having fun, sitting around all night listening to my mother say \u201cHave you ever peed so much in your life?\u201d", "Raj: Oh, my God, you are such a mama\u2019s boy.", "Howard: Hey, don\u2019t bring my mother into this!", "Raj: You brought your mother into this!", "Sheldon: Stop it, both of you. All this fighting, I might as well be back with my parents! Damn it, George, I told you if you didn\u2019t quit drinkin\u2019 I\u2019d leave you! Well, I guess that makes you a liar, \u2019cause I\u2019m drunk as hell and you\u2019re still here! Stop yelling! You\u2019re making Sheldon cry! I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s making Sheldon cry! That I let you name him Sheldon.", "Howard: Boy, what got him so upset?", "Raj: Oh, sure, you can tell when Sheldon\u2019s upset.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.", "\u00a0", "Penny: Oh, thank you very much. Come back soon. With the other half of my tip. Hey, Sheldon, what are you doing here?", "Sheldon: This is a restaurant. It\u2019s lunchtime. I would think, as a waitress, you\u2019d be familiar with the paradigm.", "Penny: Is Leonard coming?", "Sheldon: No, I believe Leonard is waiting for you to come crawling back to him and apologize.", "Penny: Well, that\u2019s not gonna happen.", "Sheldon: I assumed that would be your attitude. Hence, my true purpose in coming here.", "Penny: Which is?", "Sheldon: I want you to crawl back to him and apologize.", "Penny: I\u2019m busy.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, miss. I\u2019d like to order lunch.", "Penny: Fine. What do you want?", "Sheldon: I have a few questions. First, I notice that you offer soup and a half-sandwich?", "Penny: Yes.", "Sheldon: Where exactly does the half-sandwich come from? Are you giving me half of someone else\u2019s sandwich, or do I have to wait for someone else in the restaurant to order the other half?", "Penny: No, no, Sheldon, they just make a half-sandwich.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t make a half-sandwich. If it\u2019s not half of a whole sandwich, it\u2019s just a small sandwich.", "Penny: Okay, fine, it\u2019s soup and a small sandwich. Is that what you want?", "Sheldon: Of course not. I\u2019ll have my usual.", "Penny: Great.", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t you going to ask me if I want a beverage?", "Penny: Don\u2019t you usually get lemonade?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Penny: Do you want lemonade?", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Penny: Anything else?", "Sheldon: Yes, I want you to apologize to Leonard.", "Penny: I am not going to apologize. I\u2019ve done nothing wrong. He is completely overreacting.", "Sheldon: Irrelevant. The disruption in your relationship is making my life intolerable.", "Penny: Well, I\u2019m sorry, Sheldon, but this really isn\u2019t about you.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t follow.", "Penny: Yeah, yeah, I\u2019ll be right there. Look, Sheldon, I have to go.", "Sheldon: All right, let\u2019s assume, ad argumentum, that in this case, Leonard is wrong.", "Penny: Leonard is wrong.", "Sheldon: Considering the number of transgressions you\u2019ve committed that he\u2019s overlooked, don\u2019t you think that, just this once, you could return the favour?", "Penny: I\u2019m coming. Goodbye, Sheldon. What do you mean, transgressions I\u2019ve committed?", "Sheldon: Were you under the impression that Leonard has no complaints about you?", "Penny: Like what? Yeah, yeah, I see you, you\u2019re making a little cheque sign in the air, I got it, just hold your horses. What does Leonard complain about?", "Sheldon: Your driving, the plethora of stuffed animals on your bed that stare at him during your amorous activities, your constant tardiness, your singing.", "Penny: My singing?", "Sheldon: That\u2019s actually from my list, but Leonard would be a fool if he didn\u2019t agree with it.", "Penny: Okay, if Leonard has so many problems with me, why hasn\u2019t he just said so?", "Sheldon: Because, according to him, you\u2019re oversensitive and have a temper.", "Penny: Oh, really? Well, then, do me a favour and tell Leonard that he can drop dead!", "Sheldon: And she wonders why she\u2019s constantly undertipped.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Oh, good, you\u2019re home. I need you to do me a favour.", "Leonard: Sure.", "Sheldon: Go apologize to Penny.", "Leonard: What?", "Sheldon: Right now would be good.", "Penny (knocking): Leonard!", "Sheldon: Although, a few minutes ago would have been better.", "Penny: I hear you don\u2019t like my stuffed animals, my driving or my punctuality.", "Leonard: What? Who would tell you something like that? Why would you tell her something like that?", "Penny: It doesn\u2019t matter why he told me. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?", "Leonard: Okay, yeah, it\u2019s true, but I can live with that stuff. What I can\u2019t live with is you casually informing me that some guy\u2019s going to be staying in your apartment without even asking me first!", "Penny: That isn\u2019t even your problem, the problem is you don\u2019t trust me!", "Leonard: Oh, come on. Sheldon, have you ever once heard me say that I don\u2019t trust Penny? Sheldon? Where did he go?", "Penny: Oh, your yelling must have freaked him out again.", "Leonard: Where are you going? You just walk away in the middle of an argument?!", "Penny: No, I\u2019m going to go find your damn roommate before he hurts himself trying to cross the street or something!", "Leonard: Why didn\u2019t you say so?", "Penny: Oh, now I need your permission for that, too?!", "Leonard: Well, I can\u2019t read your mind, Penny!", "Penny: Really? Why not? You\u2019re so smart, and I\u2019m so dumb!", "Scene: Raj\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.", "Raj: Stop knocking! It\u2019s open! Please tell my parents that our dark matter research is at a critical juncture, and I can\u2019t come home for my cousin Sanjay\u2019s wedding.", "Mrs Koothrappali: Sheldon, ask our son what we\u2019re supposed to say to Mr. and Mrs. Choudhry, whose daughter, Lakshmi is flying in from London, for the sole purpose of meeting him.", "Raj: I didn\u2019t ask you to set me up with Lakshmi.", "Mrs Koothrappali: You should be thanking us!", "Dr Koothrappali: Yes, Lakshmi just got her stomach stapled. You have an opportunity to get in good with her before she loses weight, and her self-esteem goes up.", "Raj: I don\u2019t care! And why don\u2019t you think I can find a woman for myself?", "Mrs Koothrappali: Because you\u2019re 27, and the closest thing we have to a daughter-in-law is that Jewish boy Howard.", "Raj: Oh, that is completely below the belt. Sheldon, tell my parents that Howard and I are just friends. Sheldon? Howard and I are just friends! Fine. I\u2019ll come home for Sanjay\u2019s wedding.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Penny (out of the window): Sheldon! (whistles) ", "Leonard: What are you doing? He\u2019s not a lost dog.", "Penny: Hey, why don\u2019t you just let me find him while you sit there hitting your imaginary brake?", "Leonard: The brake might be imaginary, but that stop sign you just ran wasn\u2019t.", "Penny: What stop sign?", "Leonard: Eyes on the road. Eyes on the road!", "Scene: Outside Howard\u2019s house. Sheldon rings the doorbell.", "Howard\u2019s Mother: Howard, answer the door! I\u2019m busy!", "Howard: I\u2019m busy too, you answer it.", "Howard\u2019s Mother: I can\u2019t! I\u2019m on the toilet!", "Howard: For God\u2019s sake, I don\u2019t need to hear that! Can\u2019t you just say, I\u2019m busy?", "Howard\u2019s Mother: I said I\u2019m busy, but that wasn\u2019t good enough for you!", "Howard: You know what? I hope it\u2019s one of those home invasion deals, and they shoot me in the head.", "Howard\u2019s Mother: Well, if it\u2019s a home invader, don\u2019t tell them I\u2019m on the toilet!", "Howard: There\u2019s no one there. You\u2019re hearing things, you crazy old lady!", "Scene: The comic book store.", "Leonard: Hey, Stuart, have you seen Sheldon?", "Stuart: Yeah, he\u2019s, uh, over in the graphic novel section. Built himself a little nest.", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Stuart: Uh, Penny?", "Penny: Yeah?", "Stuart: Is everything okay?", "Penny: What do you mean?", "Stuart: Uh, Sheldon told me you and Leonard were having a fight?", "Penny: Oh, yeah, kind of. It\u2019s, it\u2019s no big thing.", "Stuart: Oh, good, good. (She moves away) I love you.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not leaving until you talk to me.", "Penny: All right, what\u2019s going on?", "Leonard: It\u2019s a little hard to explain. He does this thing where he pretends he\u2019s in an alternate dimension that occupies the same physical space we\u2019re in, but he can\u2019t perceive us.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I\u2019m just ignoring you.", "Penny: Come on, Sheldon, let\u2019s go home. Look, we\u2019re done fighting.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve heard that before, but then, the next thing you know I\u2019m hiding in my bedroom, blaring a Richard Feinman lecture while my mom is shouting that Jesus would forgive her if she put ground glass in my dad\u2019s meatloaf, and my dad\u2019s on the roof skeet-shooting her Franklin Mint collectible plates.", "Penny: Okay, there\u2019s going to no more shouting and no skeet-shooting.", "Sheldon: Really? Where\u2019s your friend Justin going to sleep?", "Leonard: Yeah, where\u2019s he gonna sleep?", "Penny: Oh, my God, would you let this go?!", "Stuart: I\u2019d let it go.", "Leonard: Why should I let it go? Why don\u2019t you just tell the guy to find another place to sleep? (Sheldon turns on a loud toy robot) Oh, for God\u2019s sakes. So, you have childhood issues, we all have childhood issues, at some point, you just need to grow up and get past them. (Sheldon turns on another robot)", "Penny: Leonard, will you just let me handle this, please? Look, let\u2019s just\u2026 Sheldon, please,", "try and understand. Look, Leonard and I are in a relationship, and occasionally, we\u2019re going to fight. But no matter what happens between us, we will always love you. Right, Leonard?", "Leonard: Always is a long time. Sure. Always.", "Penny: You know, how about we buy you this robot, and then we all go home?", "Sheldon: I want that one.", "Penny: Okay, you can have that one.", "Leonard: Oh, come on, he\u2019s just going to play with it twice, and then it\u2019ll end up in his closet with all the other junk.", "Penny: Buy him the robot, Leonard.", "Sheldon: Can I get this comic book, too?", "Penny: Yes, you can.", "Stuart: We meet again.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bed. ", "Leonard: So what did Justin say when you told him he couldn\u2019t sleep on your couch?", "Penny: He\u2019s a musician. He\u2019ll sleep in his own vomit, if he has to.", "Scene: The apartment. Sheldon is in his spot. Beside him, a long haired bearded person is asleep. There is a guitar propped up on the arm of the sofa.", "Sheldon: I should have asked for much more than a comic book and a robot."]}
