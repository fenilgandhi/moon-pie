All have long hair and bushy beards except Sheldon, whose hair is slightly longer and who has a goatee. ", "Leonard: Oh, thank God we\u2019re home.", "Howard: I can\u2019t believe we spent three months in that frozen hell.", "Raj: It was like a snowy nightmare from which there was no awakening.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know what Arctic expedition you guys were on, but I thought it was a hoot and a half.", "Scene: The apartment door. Sheldon is on the phone.", "Sheldon: Oh, hi mom. No, I told you I\u2019d call you when I got home, I\u2019m not home yet. (Walks through door) Alright, I\u2019m home. The Arctic expedition was a remarkable success, I\u2019m all but certain there\u2019s a Nobel Prize in my future. Actually, I shouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m entirely certain. No, mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I\u2019m home safe is not proof that it worked, that logic is Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc. No, I\u2019m not sassing you in Eskimo talk.", "Leonard: I\u2019m going to go let Penny know we\u2019re back.", "Sheldon: Mother, I have to go. Yeah, love you. Bye. (To his spot) Hello, old friend. (Sits) Daddy\u2019s home.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s door.", "Penny: Leonard, you\u2019re back.", "Leonard: Yeah, I just stopped by to say\u2026 (she grabs him and kisses him) Yeah, so, hi!", "Penny: Hi! (They stumble, kissing, into her apartment and slam the door shut)", "Howard: Dammit, I should have gone over and told her we were back.", "Raj: Yeah, it was first come, first served.", "Credits sequence. ", "Scene: A moment later.", "Sheldon: I just want you both to know, when I publish my findings, I won\u2019t forget your contributions.", "Howard: Great.", "Raj: Thanks.", "Sheldon: Of course, I can\u2019t mention you in my Nobel acceptance speech, but when I get round to writing my memoirs you can expect a very effusive footnote, and perhaps a signed copy.", "Raj: We have to tell him.", "Sheldon: Tell me what?", "Howard: Damn his Vulcan hearing.", "Sheldon: You fellows are planning a party for me, aren\u2019t you?", "Howard: Okay, Sheldon, sit down.", "Sheldon: If there\u2019s going to be a theme, I should let you know that I don\u2019t care for luau, toga or under the sea.", "Howard: Yeah, we\u2019ll keep that in mind, look, we need to talk to you about something that happened at the North Pole.", "Sheldon: If this is about the night the heat went out, there\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about.", "Raj: It\u2019s not about that.", "Howard: And we agreed to never speak of it again.", "Sheldon: So we slept together naked. It was only to keep our core body temperatures from plummeting.", "Howard: He\u2019s speaking about it.", "Raj: For me, it was a bonding moment.", "Howard: Sheldon, you remember the first few weeks we were looking for magnetic monopoles and not finding anything and you were acting like an obnoxious, giant dictator?", "Raj: I thought we were going to be gentle with him.", "Howard: That\u2019s why I added the tator. And then when we found our first positive data, you were so happy.", "Sheldon: Oh, yes. In the world of emoticons, I was colon, capital D.", "Howard: Well, in actuality, what your equipment detected wasn\u2019t so much evidence of paradigm-shifting monopoles as it was\u2026 static from the electric can opener we were turning on and off.", "Raj: He just went colon, capital O.", "Sheldon: You tampered with my experiment?", "Howard: We had to.", "Raj: It was the only way to keep you from being such a huge Dickensian. You see that? I added the ensian.", "Sheldon: Did Leonard know about this? Leonard\u2019s my best friend in the world. Surely Leonard didn\u2019t know.", "Howard: Actually, it was his idea.", "Sheldon: Of course it was. The whole plan reeks of Leonard.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny: I missed you so much.", "Leonard: I missed you, too.", "Penny: I couldn\u2019t even think of anyone else while you were gone.", "Leonard: Me, neither. Except for one night when the heat went out. Long story, it\u2019s\u2026 don\u2019t ask.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard. (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard.", "Leonard (whispering): Do not make a sound.", "Sheldon: Whispering do not make a sound is a sound.", "Leonard: Damn his Vulcan hearing. Not a good time, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Knock, knock, knock) Penny.", "Penny: Oh, this is ridiculous. What?", "Sheldon: Hello, Penny. I realize you\u2019re currently at the mercy of your primitive biological urges, but as you have an entire lifetime of poor decisions ahead of you, may I interrupt this one?", "Penny: It\u2019s great to see you too. Come on in.", "Sheldon: Wolowitz has informed me of your grand deception. Do you have anything to say for yourself?", "Leonard: Yes, I feel terrible about it. I will never forgive myself, I don\u2019t expect you to either, and I would really appreciate it if you would leave me with Penny for a session of self-criticism and repentance.", "Penny: Okay, can someone please tell me what\u2019s going on here?", "Sheldon: What\u2019s going on is I was led to believe I was making groundbreaking strides in science, when in fact, I was being fed false data at the hands of Wolowitz, Koothrappali and your furry little boy toy.", "Penny: Is that true?", "Leonard: It was the only way to make him happy.", "Penny: Why did you have to make him happy?", "Leonard: Because when he wasn\u2019t happy, we wanted to kill him. There was even a plan. We were going to throw his Kindle outside, and when he went to get it, lock the door and let him freeze to death.", "Sheldon: That seems like a bit of an overreaction.", "Leonard: No, the overreaction was the plan to tie your limbs to four different sled dog teams and yell mush. Look, we kept the original data. You can still publish the actual results.", "Sheldon: Yes, but the actual results are unsuccessful and I\u2019ve already sent an e-mail to everyone at the university explaining that I have confirmed string theory and forever changed man\u2019s understanding of the universe.", "Leonard: Aw, see, yeah, you probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. So write another e-mail, set the record straight, it\u2019s no big deal.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re right, Leonard, it\u2019s not a big deal. All you did was lie to me destroy my dream and humiliate me in front of the whole university. That, FYI, was sarcasm. I, in fact, believe it is a big deal", "Penny: Oh, the poor thing.", "Leonard: Yeah, I feel terrible.", "Penny: Wait, wait. Aren\u2019t you going to go talk to him?", "Leonard: What? Uh, he\u2019ll be fine, the guy\u2019s a trouper, come here.", "Penny: No, you\u2019re right, you shouldn\u2019t talk to him. I will.", "Leonard: Man, I cannot catch a break.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Penny knocks and enters.", "Penny: Hey. Do you want to talk?", "Sheldon: About what? Being betrayed by my friends? Spending three months at the North Pole for nothing? And I didn\u2019t even get to go to Comic-Con!", "Penny: Oh, hon\u2026 Uh\u2026 (singing)  Soft kitty, warm kitty\u2026", "Sheldon: That\u2019s for when I\u2019m sick. Sad is not sick.", "Penny: Oh. Sorry. I don\u2019t know your sad song.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t have a sad song. I\u2019m not a child.", "Penny: Well, you know, I do understand what you\u2019re going through.", "Sheldon: Really? Did you just have the Nobel Prize in waitressing stolen from you?", "Penny: Well, no, but when I was a senior in high school, one of my friends heard I was going to be named head cheerleader. Oh, I was so excited. My mom even made me a celebration pie. Then they named stupid Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader. Big ol\u2019 slutbag.", "Sheldon: Are you saying that you think a celebration pie is even remotely comparable to a Nobel Prize?", "Penny: Well, they\u2019re pretty tasty.", "Sheldon: And on a different, but not unrelated topic, based on your current efforts to buoy my spirits, do you truly believe that you were ever fit to be a cheer leader?", "Penny: Look, Sheldon, I just don\u2019t think that the guys and Leonard really meant to hurt you. You know? They just told an unfortunate lie to deal with a difficult situation. Okay, you know what it\u2019s like? Remember that scene in the new Star Trek movie when Kirk has to take over the ship, so he tells Spock all that stuff he knew wasn\u2019t true, like saying Spock didn\u2019t care his mom died?", "Sheldon: I missed Comic-Con and the new Star Trek movie!", "Scene: The university cafeteria. The guys have shaved and had haircuts. Howard has kept his moustache.", "Raj: I like the new look.", "Howard: Thanks. I call it the Clooney.", "Raj: I call it the Mario and Luigi, but whatever. Hey, how\u2019s Sheldon doing?", "Leonard: Well, he came out of his room this morning wearing his Darth Vader helmet and tried to choke me to death with the Force, so I\u2019d say, a little better.", "Howard: If I may abruptly change the subject, did you and Penny finally\u2026 you know.", "Leonard: Howard\u2026", "Howard: Personally, I don\u2019t care, but my genitals wanted me to ask.", "Leonard: Well, tell your genitals what I do with Penny is none of their business.", "Howard (to his genitals): He says they didn\u2019t do it.", "Leonard (to Sheldon, entering): Sheldon, over here. (Sheldon sits at another table and tries to choke all three to death with the force. Raj pretends he is choking.) ", "Howard: What are you doing?", "Raj: I feel bad for the guy.", "Leonard: Sheldon, why are you sitting by yourself?", "Sheldon: Because I am without friends. Like the proverbial cheese, I stand alone. Even while seated.", "Leonard: Come on. We said we were sorry.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s going to take more than I\u2019m sorry and a store-bought apology pie from Penny to make up for what you\u2019ve done to me.", "Kripke (arriving): Hey, Cooper. Wead your wetwaction e-mail. Way to destroy your weputation.", "Sheldon: You see? People have been pointing and laughing at me all morning.", "Kripke: That\u2019s not twue. People have been pointing and waughing at you your whole wife.", "Sheldon: All right, I\u2019ve had enough. Attention, everyone. I\u2019 m Dr. Sheldon Cooper. As many of you in the physics department might know, my career trajectory has taken a minor detour.", "Kripke: Off a cwiff.", "Sheldon: My credibility may have been damaged\u2026", "Kripke: Compwetely wecked.", "Sheldon: But I would like to remind you that in science, there\u2019s no such thing as failure. There once was a man who referred to his prediction of a cosmological constant as the single biggest blunder of his career. That man\u2019s name was, surprise, surprise, Albert Einstein.", "Kripke: Yeah, but wesearch into Dark Energy pwoved that Einstein\u2019s cosmowogical constant was actually wight all along, so you\u2019re still, surpwise, surpwise, a woser.", "Sheldon: Oh, you think you\u2019re so clever. Well, let me just tell you, while I do not currently have a scathing retort, you check your e-mail periodically for a doozy.", "Leonard: So much for our friendship with Sheldon.", "Raj: Well, we\u2019ll always have the night the heat went out.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Penny: Hi.", "Leonard: Hey. Listen, since we got, you know, interrupted last night, I didn\u2019t have a chance to give you this.", "Penny: Oh, Leonard, you shouldn\u2019t have. Oh, boy! What is it?", "Leonard: It\u2019s a snowflake. From the North Pole.", "Penny: Are you serious?", "Leonard: Uh-huh. It\u2019ll last forever. I preserved it in a one percent solution of polyvinyl acetal resin.", "Penny: Oh, my God. That\u2019s the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever said to me that I didn\u2019t understand.", "Leonard: It\u2019s actually a pretty simple process. You see, cyanoacrylate are monomers which polymerize on\u2026 (she kisses him) ", "Howard (arriving): Red alert, Leonard. Sheldon ran away.", "Leonard: Man, I can not catch a break.", "Penny: So, how do you know he ran away?", "Howard: Well, he\u2019s not answering his phone, he handed in his resignation at the university and he sent me a text that said, I\u2019m running away.", "Leonard: Okay, well, thanks for letting me know.", "Penny: Well, Leonard, aren\u2019t you going to do something?", "Leonard: Of course I\u2019m going to do something. Uh, Howard, you check the comic book store. Raj, go to the Thai restaurant. I\u2019ll stay here with Penny in her apartment. (His phone rings) Oh, damn it. It\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s mother. A break cannot be caught. Hi, Mrs. Cooper. He is? Sheldon went home to Texas. Yeah, no, I know he resigned. Yes, I guess it kind of is our fault. No, no, no, you, you\u2019re right, someone needs to come talk to him. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of it. Yeah. All right. New plan. Howard, you and Raj go to Texas. I\u2019ll stay here with Penny in her apartment.", "Penny: Well, you\u2019re not gonna go with them?", "Leonard: Well, you know, I gave you the snowflake and we were kissing and\u2026 Oh, come on, I don\u2019t want to go to Texas!", "Howard: Oh, right, and I do? My people already crossed a desert once, we\u2019re done.", "Leonard: Trust me, you\u2019ll be fine. See ya.", "Penny: Well, wait a second, Leonard, come on, how can you not go? He\u2019s your best friend.", "Leonard: Yeah, but I already saw him naked. Just come here.", "Penny: No. I promise I will be here when you get back. Just go help Sheldon.", "Leonard: Really?", "Penny: Yeah. We waited a few months. We can wait a few more days.", "Leonard: Maybe you can.", "Penny: Go.", "Raj: Boy, you cannot catch a break, can you?", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s mother\u2019s kitchen. ", "\u00a0", "Mrs Cooper: Here you go, Shelly.", "Sheldon: Thanks, Mom.", "Mrs Cooper: Hold your horses, young man. Here in Texas, we pray before we eat.", "Sheldon: Aw, Mom.", "Mrs Cooper: This is not California, land of the heathen. Gimme. By His hand we are all\u2026", "Sheldon: Fed.", "Mrs Cooper: Give us, Lord, our daily\u2026", "Sheldon: Bread.", "Mrs Cooper: Please know that we are truly\u2026", "Sheldon: Grateful.", "Mrs Cooper: For every cup and every\u2026", "Sheldon: Plateful.", "Mrs Cooper: Amen. Now, that wasn\u2019t so hard, was it?", "Sheldon: My objection was based on considerations other than difficulty.", "Mrs Cooper: Whatever. Jesus still loves you.", "Sheldon: Thank you for carving a smiley face in my grilled cheese sandwich.", "Mrs Cooper: Oh, I know how to take care of my baby. His eyes came out a little thin, but you can just pretend he\u2019s Chinese. So, do you want to talk about what happened with you and your little friends?", "Sheldon: They\u2019re not my friends.", "Mrs Cooper: All right. If you recall, when you were little, we sat right here at this very spot and we talked about some of the problems you had getting along with the neighbour kids.", "Sheldon: That was different. They were threatened by my intelligence and too stupid to know that\u2019s why they hated me.", "Mrs Cooper: Oh baby, they knew very well why they hated you.", "Scene: A rental car.", "\u00a0", "Leonard: I can\u2019t believe you bought a red cowboy hat.", "Howard: Hello? I\u2019m wearing a red turtleneck. Plus, it was the only boys\u2019 large they had.", "Raj: I\u2019m sorry, this does not look like Texas. Where\u2019s the tumbleweeds? Where\u2019s the saloons?", "Leonard: Saloons?", "Raj: Yeah, like in the movies I saw growing up in India. You know, uh, Four for Texas, Yellow Rose of Texas.", "Howard: This neighbourhood is more Texas Chainsaw Massacre.", "Raj: I was really hoping to see a cattle drive.", "Leonard: What can I tell you? They probably have steaks on sale at that big-ass Costco over there.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s mother\u2019s house.", "Leonard: Will you please take that stupid hat off?", "Howard: No, I want to blend in.", "Raj: To what? Toy Story?", "Mrs Cooper: Hi, boys.", "Howard: Howdy, ma\u2019am.", "Mrs Cooper: Howdy to you, too. You got here quick.", "Leonard: \u2013 We took the red-eye.", "Mrs Cooper: Well, come on in.", "Howard: Thank you kindly.", "Mrs Cooper: Can I\u2026 Can I get you something to drink?", "Leonard: Uh, no, thank you.", "Howard: If y\u2019all don\u2019t mind, I got a hankerin\u2019 for a Lone Star beer.", "Mrs Cooper: There\u2019s no alcohol in this household. Stop talking like that and lose the hat.", "Howard: Sorry. I\u2019ll take a diet Yoo-Hoo if you have it.", "Mrs Cooper: You\u2019ll take a Cola.* What about you? Radge, isn\u2019t it? Oh, you still having trouble talking to the ladies? Because, you know, at our church we have a woman who\u2019s an amazing healer. Mostly she does, uh, crutch and wheelchair people, but I bet she\u2019d be willing to take a shot at whatever Third World demon is running around inside of you.", "Leonard: Uh, if you don\u2019t mind, Mrs. Cooper, there\u2019s a 3:05 nonstop back to Los Angeles, and you have no idea how much I want to be on it.", "Mrs Cooper: A girl?", "Leonard: Uh, yes, ma\u2019am.", "Mrs Cooper: Oh, good. I\u2019ve been praying for you. Oh, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: What are they doing here?", "Leonard: We came to apologize.", "Howard: Again.", "Leonard: And bring you home. So, why don\u2019t you pack up your stuff and we\u2019ll head back.", "Leonard: No, this is my home now. Thanks to you, my career is over and I will spend the rest of my life here in Texas trying to teach evolution to creationists.", "Mrs Cooper: You watch your mouth, Shelly. Everyone\u2019s entitled to their opinion.", "Sheldon: Evolution isn\u2019t an opinion, it\u2019s fact.", "Mrs Cooper: And that is your opinion.", "Sheldon: I forgive you. Let\u2019s go home.", "Mrs Cooper: Don\u2019t tell me prayer doesn\u2019t work.", "Scene: In Penny\u2019s bed.", "Leonard: How about that? I finally caught a break.", "Penny: Uh-huh.", "Leonard: You know how they say when friends have sex it can get weird?", "Penny: Sure.", "Leonard: Why does it have to get weird?", "Penny: I don\u2019t know.", "Leonard: I mean, we were friends, and now we\u2019re more than friends. We\u2019re whatever this is. But why label it, right? I mean, it is what it is and\u2026", "Penny: Leonard?", "Leonard: Yeah?", "Penny: It\u2019s weird.", "Leonard: Totally.", "(* This scene was originally filmed using the word \u201ccoke\u201d but it was overdubbed for television purposes.
