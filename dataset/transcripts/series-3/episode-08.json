We have the west coast feed of HBO.", "Howard: Ooh, Real Sex.", "Raj: Big deal. Every time I watch that show it\u2019s old women putting condoms on cucumbers.", "Howard: Alright, let\u2019s see what\u2019s on the east coast feed.", "Leonard: Oh, hey. Dune.", "Raj: Not a great movie, but look at that beautiful desert.", "Leonard: Too bad Sheldon couldn\u2019t come with us.", "Raj: Yes, it\u2019s not the same without him.

Yeah, I\u2019m going to be dining alone this evening, so I\u2019ll be reducing my usual order. I\u2019d like to start with one quarter of the assorted appetizers plate and, uh, one half of the golden treasure for two. Oh, for heaven\u2019s sake, in the mid-18th century, King Rama IV of Siam divided a huge empire amongst the colonial powers of Europe in order to preserve his throne. Surely, you, his cultural descendant, can handle pad thai and dumplings.", "Penny (voice off): Sheldon help!", "Sheldon: I need to go, but you keep in mind that my sharply worded comments on yelp.com recently took down a local muffin store.

Don\u2019t you dare knock.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: I slipped in the shower, and I think I dislocated my shoulder.", "Sheldon: Not surprising. You have no safety mat or adhesive stickers to allow for purchase on a surface with a low coefficient of static friction.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Tubs are slippery.", "Penny: I know. I slipped.", "Sheldon: I have a series of whimsical duck stickers on the bottom of my tub.", "Penny: Yeah, okay, whatever. Will you just turn the water off and help me up?", "Sheldon: They\u2019re holding umbrellas.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: The ducks in my tub.", "Penny: Uh-huh.", "Sheldon: They\u2019re whimsical because ducks have neither the need for, nor the ability to use umbrellas.", "Penny: Oh, my god.

Let it never be said that Sheldon Lee Cooper ignored the pleas of a damsel in distress.", "Penny: No one\u2019s saying that.

Mostly science nerds like us, but just over yon ridge are two not unattractive middle school teachers who reek of desperation.", "Raj: Wow. Wonderful. How old are they?", "Howard: Oh I don\u2019t know, 50, 55.", "Raj: Oh, menopause, nature\u2019s birth control.", "Leonard: Come on, you guys can\u2019t be that hard up.", "Howard: I am.", "Raj: Yeah, me, too.", "Howard: Look, they gave me homemade cookies.", "Leonard: Of course, they did. That\u2019s what grandmothers do.", "Raj: So, what are we waiting for?", "Howard: Relax, I said we\u2019d stop by a little later after they have their nap.", "Raj: Good idea. They\u2019ll be refreshed.", "Howard: Cookie?", "Raj: Yeah, thank you. Mmmm.", "Leonard: Mmmm, not bad.", "Raj: Yeah, very tasty. Well, so tell me more about these teachers.", "Howard: Not much to tell. They had a VW Microbus and were wearing tie-dyed Grateful Dead shirts.", "Raj: Huh. Mmm. Good cookies.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s bedroom.", "Sheldon: I see no organizational system in here whatsoever.

Those shorts with that top?", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: No\u2026 No\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s cute.", "Sheldon: We should have you checked for a concussion.", "Penny: Okay, now, you got to help me put these on.", "Sheldon: All right.", "Penny: But don\u2019t look.", "Sheldon: Don\u2019t look?", "Penny: I don\u2019t want you to see me naked.", "Sheldon: Oh. Well, that\u2019s understandable. You may be interested to know that a prohibition against looking is well established in heroic mythology.

It never ends well.", "Penny: Ok, now you gotta help me get my arm into the sleeve.", "Sheldon: Ok.", "Penny: Is that my arm?", "Sheldon: It doesn\u2019t feel like an arm.", "Penny: Then, maybe you should let it go.", "Sheldon: All righty.", "Scene: The camp site.

I can feel the earth moving. It\u2019s moving too fast. Raj, slow it down.", "Raj: Okay, how\u2019s that?", "Leonard: Better. Thanks.", "Howard: Stars are pretty, aren\u2019t they?", "Leonard: What\u2019s so funny?", "Raj: It\u2019s your American accent. Everything you say sounds stupid.

According to my driver\u2019s ed book, a side mirror is properly adjusted when a portion of the is driver\u2019s door handle is visible in the lower right corner. There\u2019s the handle. Oh, no, too far, bringing it back. Optimized. Now, where is the switch to adjust the passenger side mirror?", "Penny: It\u2019s right there.", "Sheldon: Where is the passenger side mirror?", "Penny: In a parking lot in Hollywood.

I am embarrassed, so I eat all the lettuce in the world and make them watch.", "Leonard: People could call me Angie. Yo, Angie, how\u2019s it goin\u2019?", "Howard: To this day, I can\u2019t look at pickled herring without being aroused and ashamed. Oh, cousin Jeanie.", "Scene: Penny\u2019s car.", "Penny: Could you please drive a little faster?", "Sheldon: Oh, I think we\u2019re going sufficiently fast. What\u2019s that?", "Penny: Nothing. The engine does that sometimes.", "Sheldon: That can\u2019t be nothing, the check engine light is on. We need to find a service station.", "Penny: No. The light has been on since I bought the car.", "Sheldon: All the more reason to consult with a mechanic before it explodes.", "Penny: It\u2019s not going to explode, just keep driving. Warp speed ahead, Mr. Spock.", "Sheldon: Mr. Spock did not pilot the Enterprise. He was the science officer, and I guarantee you that if he ever saw the Enterprise\u2019s check engine light blinking, he would pull the ship over immediately.", "Penny: Oh, god, I\u2019m gonna lose the arm.", "Sheldon: Oh, oh, red light, release accelerator and slowly apply the brake. Nailed it. While we have a moment, may I ask you a question?", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Why do you have the Chinese character for soup tattooed on your right buttock?", "Penny: It\u2019s not soup, it\u2019s courage.", "Sheldon: No, it isn\u2019t. But I suppose it does take courage to demonstrate that kind of commitment to soup.", "Penny: How did you see it? You said you wouldn\u2019t look.", "Sheldon: Sorry. As I told you, the hero always peeks.", "Scene: The camp site. ", "Howard: Anything?", "Leonard: No. That was the last pudding cup.", "Howard: No! What about Slim Jims?", "Leonard: That\u2019s what he used to eat his pudding, remember?", "Raj: Right! That was so good! Sweety and meaty at the same time.", "Howard: Wait. Wait, wait. So you\u2019re saying we\u2019re out of food?", "Leonard: The only thing in here are blue ice packs.", "Raj: I know they\u2019re poison, but they look like big, yummy otter pops.", "Leonard: Oh, god, I am so hungry.", "Howard: Me too. Check and see if we have any more pudding.", "Leonard: Okay.", "Scene: The hospital waiting room.", "Sheldon: All right, there\u2019s no need to bark at me.

We have to fill these out. Describe illness or injury.", "Penny: I dislocated my shoulder.", "Sheldon: All right.

You look a bit puffy.", "Penny: Change migraine to yes.", "Sheldon: When was your last menstrual period?", "Penny: Oh, next question.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll put, in progress. Okay, moving to psychiatric disorders, list all major behavioural diagnoses, e.g. depression, anxiety, etcetera.", "Penny: Oh, my god, what the hell does this have to do with my stupid shoulder?", "Sheldon: Episodes of sub psychotic rage.", "Penny: Ass.", "Sheldon: Possible Tourette\u2019s. All right, moles, lesions or other skin conditions. Soup tattoo on right buttock.", "Penny: Hey, Sheldon, Sheldon, look, I am scared and in a lot of pain. Could you please just take a break from being you for just a minute and try being, I don\u2019t know, comforting?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. There, there. Everything\u2019s going to be fine.

We\u2019re all hungry.", "Howard: Okay, our objective is the boy scout campsite to the east. Easy target.

Yes! My mother put an I love you brisket in my backpack.", "Leonard: Quick, get forks.", "Howard: You don\u2019t need forks. It\u2019s so tender, it falls apart in your hands.", "Raj: He\u2019s right.", "Leonard: I feel like we\u2019re forgetting something important.", "Raj: Me, too. But what? (Behind them, the meteor shower has begun)", "Howard: Maybe a tupperware bowl of roasted potatoes and carrots?", "Leonard and Raj together: Yes! Yes!", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Now remember, you were given powerful pain medication and a muscle relaxer, so, uh, don\u2019t operate heavy machinery. Try not to choke on your own drool.", "Penny: Wait. You have to help me get into bed. Sheldon has to get me into bed. Bet you never thought I\u2019d say that.", "Sheldon: Yes. The charm of your drug addled candour knows no bounds.", "Penny: You know, people think you\u2019re this weird robot man who\u2019s so annoying all the time, and you totally are, but then it\u2019s like that movie Wall-E at the end. You\u2019re so full of love, and you can save a plant and get fat people out of the floaty chairs.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s a fairly laboured metaphor, but I appreciate the sentiment behind it.", "Penny: Sing \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d to me.", "Sheldon: \u201cSoft Kitty\u201d is for when you\u2019re sick.

I\u2019ll start. Soft kitty, warm kitty, little ball of fur\u2026 See that\u2019s where you come in. I\u2019ll start over.
