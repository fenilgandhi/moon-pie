How hard is that?", "Penny (arriving): Hi, guys. Hi, honey.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Howard: Ooh, we\u2019re honey now, are we?", "Sheldon: Yes. Since their relationship became carnal, Penny has upgraded his designated term of endearment, thus distinguishing him from those she calls sweetie, usually in an attempt to soften a thinly-veiled insult.", "Penny: You\u2019re boring people sweetie.", "Sheldon: Although, sometimes, she omits the veil entirely.", "Penny: So, what are you guys doing?", "Howard: Celebrating Columbus Day.", "Leonard: We\u2019re watching Goonies, Gremlins and Young Sherlock Holmes. They were all written by Chris Columbus.", "Penny: Okay. What do you watch on Thanksgiving?", "Sheldon: The parade.", "Penny: Oh, you know, that reminds me, I usually go back to Nebraska for thanksgiving, but this year they\u2019re calling it off on account of my brother\u2019s trial.", "Leonard: What\u2019s he on trial for?", "Penny: Oh, just a big misunderstanding. You know, you\u2019d actually like my brother, he\u2019s kind of a chemist. Anyway, I was thinking I\u2019d have thanksgiving here, and you are all invited.", "Leonard: Oh. I\u2019ll be there.", "Sheldon: Will you be serving cranberry jelly or cranberry sauce?", "Penny: I guess I could serve both.", "Sheldon: You guess? You don\u2019t seem to have much of a handle on this.", "Howard: Yeah, I really wish I could, Penny, but every year my mother has all the relatives over and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.", "Penny: Tur-briska-fil?", "Howard: Turkey stuffed with a brisket stuffed with gefilte fish. It\u2019s not as good as it sounds.", "Penny: Raj, what about you?", "Howard: Oh, he usually comes to my house. Right, pal? (Raj bursts into tears and runs away) All right, this year, you don\u2019t have to eat the tur-briska-fil. I don\u2019t even chew it. I swallow it like pills.", "Credits sequence. ", "\u00a0", "Scene: A few moments later.", "Leonard: So, what\u2019s going on with Raj?", "Howard: Well, the good news is, he has no problem with my mother\u2019s tur-brka-fil.", "Penny: Hard to believe, but go on.", "Howard: The bad news is, he says he\u2019s getting deported.", "Leonard: What do you mean, he\u2019s getting deported?", "Sheldon: I believe it means that the U.S. Government is going to expel him from the country. He could then either return to his native India, emigrate to another country that\u2019s willing to accept him, or wander the high seas as a stateless pirate. Personally, I\u2019d choose pirate.", "Howard: Penny, would you mind stepping outside so we can speak to him?", "Penny: Ugh, fine. But the man really needs to work on his girl issues.", "Sheldon: Another reason to consider a life of piracy. Even today, I understand that\u2019s an all-male profession.", "Howard: Okay, she\u2019s gone.", "Raj: Sorry. I lost my cool.", "Leonard: So, what\u2019s going on?", "Raj: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, six months ago, my research testing the predicted composition of trans-Neptunian objects ran into a dead end.", "Howard: So?", "Raj: So, my visa\u2019s only good as long as I\u2019m employed at the university, and when they find out I\u2019ve got squat, they\u2019re going to cut me off. By the way, when I say squat, I mean diddly-squat. I wish I had squat.", "Leonard: So, wait, what have you been doing for the past six months?", "Raj: You know, checking e-mail, updating my facebook status, messing up wikipedia entries. Hey, did you know Netflix lets you stream movies on your computer now?", "Sheldon: And you\u2019ve continued to take the university\u2019s money under false pretences? Highly unethical for an astrophysicist. Although practically mandatory for a pirate.", "Raj: I don\u2019t want to go back to India. It\u2019s hot and loud, and there\u2019s so many people. You have no idea, they\u2019re everywhere.", "Howard: Okay, guys, think, how do we keep Raj in the country?", "Penny (from outside): Why doesn\u2019t he just get another job?", "Howard (after Raj whispers to him): What are you asking me for? I don\u2019t know if you can talk now or not.", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Raj: Oh, beef, I\u2019m going to miss you so much. Do you know, at the Mumbai McDonald\u2019s, you can\u2019t get a Big Mac? All you can get is a Chicken Maharaja Mac. And the special sauce, curry, which, in India,", "believe you me, is really not that special.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find another job.", "Raj: Yeah let me start practicing for it. Do you want fries with that Maharaja Mac?\u201d", "Sheldon: Hi, Leonard. Hello, Raj.", "Raj: Hello Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Forgive me, as you know, I\u2019m no adept at reading facial cues, but I\u2019m going to take a stab here, you\u2019re either sad or nauseated.", "Raj: I\u2019m sad.", "Sheldon: I was going to say sad. I don\u2019t know why I hedged.", "Raj: What are you eating?", "Sheldon: Elbow macaroni with ground hamburger and tomato sauce.", "Raj: Oh, beefaroni. I think I\u2019ll miss you most of all.", "Leonard: I\u2019ve always been a little confused about this. Why don\u2019t Hindus eat beef?", "Raj: We believe cows are gods.", "Sheldon: Not technically. In Hinduism, cattle are thought to be like God.", "Raj: Do not tell me about my own culture, Sheldon! In the mood I\u2019m in, I\u2019ll take you out, I swear to cow!", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry.", "Raj: Me, too. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m a little on edge.", "Sheldon: Understandable. Your entire life seems to be crumbling around you, and your future appears bleak at best.", "Raj: Thank you.", "Sheldon: And you\u2019re wrong about Hinduism and cows.", "Howard (arriving): Hey, Raj, guess what. Professor Laughlin is looking for someone to join the stellar evolution research team.", "Raj: You, you\u2019re kidding. That\u2019s fantastic!", "Howard: Come on, what are you waiting for? Call him and set up an interview.", "Raj: I\u2019m on it.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s happy, right?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Nailed it.", "Scene: Professor Laughlin\u2019s office.", "Prof Laughlin: Dr. Koothrappali, come on in. I was surprised to hear you were interested In joining our little team. Giving up on those trans-Neptunian objects, are we?", "Raj: No, no, it\u2019s a very promising area. In a perfect world I\u2019d spend several more years on it. But I just couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to work with you on your tremendously exciting and not yet conclusively disproved hypothesis.", "Prof Laughlin: Splendid. Uh, please sit down. Can I offer you a sherry?", "Raj: It\u2019s a little early, isn\u2019t it?", "Prof Laughlin: Not on Proxima Centauri.", "Raj: That\u2019s very good. Jolly amusing, but if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll hold off until sunset on titan.", "Prof Laughlin: Oh, well done. I have a feeling you\u2019re going to fit in just fine, Dr. Koothrappali.", "Raj: Thank you, sir. (There is a knock on the door. A young woman enters)", "Woman: I\u2019m sorry. Am I late?", "Prof Laughlin: No, no, no. Right on time. Dr. Koothrappali, may I present Dr. Millstone from MIT. She\u2019ll be heading up our data analysis team.", "Dr Millstone: It\u2019s nice to meet you, Dr. Koothrappali. I read your paper on Kuiper belt object size distribution. I really enjoyed it. How did you correct for the selection bias? (During this, Raj surreptitiously wanders over to where Prof Laughlin\u2019s drinks are, pours himself a large sherry and knocks it back in one.)", "Raj: Well, I ran a simulation that allowed me to correct for the observational efficiency.", "Dr Millstone: That\u2019s just fascinating.", "Raj: Thank you. Would you like to hear more about it in my hot tub? So, when do I start?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: What do you mean you didn\u2019t get the job? How could you not get it?", "Raj: You know, he\u2019s British, I\u2019m Indian, ever since Gandhi they haven\u2019t liked us very much.", "Leonard: Wait, are you saying that he discriminated against you? Because we should file a complaint.", "Raj: That\u2019s okay. A complaint has been filed. So, that\u2019s it. That was my last hope. I\u2019m going to be deported, sent home in disgrace, exposed to the sardonic barbs of my cousin Sanjay. Or, as you may know him, Dave from AT&T customer service.", "Howard: I\u2019m really going to miss you.", "Raj: Will you come visit me in India?", "Howard: Gee, that\u2019s, like, a 17-hour flight. How about I meet you halfway?", "Raj: Halfway is 600 miles off the coast of Japan.", "Howard: Tell you what, we\u2019ll skype.", "Sheldon (arriving): Gentlemen.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Raj, did you get the job with Professor Laughlin?", "Raj: No.", "Sheldon: I assumed as much. But never fear. Like the subordinate male protagonist in countless action movies who disappears half way through the second reel, I have returned to save the day. Odd, usually, he\u2019s met by cheers. Anyway, I was thinking about exploring the string theory implications of gamma rays from dark matter annihilations, and it occurred to me that I could benefit\u2026", "Leonard: Excuse me, Sheldon, how many reels before the subordinate male protagonist gets to his point?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, if you didn\u2019t cheer at my entrance, it\u2019s too late to buy into the premise. Anyway, I got some extra money from the head of the department, and raj can come work for me.", "Raj: You want me to work with you?", "Sheldon: For me. You\u2019re going to have to listen more carefully when you\u2019re on the job.", "Raj: Okay, uh, please don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but I\u2019d rather swim buck-naked across the Ganges with a paper cut on my nipple and die a slow, agonizing death from a viral infection than work with you.", "Sheldon: For me.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Raj (knocking and entering): Sheldon, are you busy?", "Sheldon: Of course I\u2019m busy.", "Raj: Shall I wait?", "Sheldon: Yes, please. (After about 30 seconds) How may I help you?", "Raj: I\u2019ve reconsidered your offer to let me work with you.", "Sheldon: For me.", "Raj: Yes, for you. I do, however, have a few conditions. First, at all times, I am to be treated as a colleague and an equal. Second, my contributions shall be noted in all published material. And third, you are never allowed to lecture me on Hinduism or my Indian culture.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m impressed, Raj. Those are very cogent and reasonable conditions.", "Raj: Thank you.", "Sheldon: I reject them all.", "Raj: Then you leave me no choice. I accept the job.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry, I believe you\u2019ve misunderstood. I\u2019m not giving you the job. I\u2019m simply affording you the opportunity to apply for it. Have a seat, we\u2019ll get started with the interview.", "Raj: Wha\u2026 You\u2019re kidding!", "Sheldon: Please.", "Raj: All right.", "Sheldon: So, that\u2019s what you wear to an interview?", "Raj: Come on, dude, we\u2019ve been friends for years.", "Sheldon: Oh, pulling strings, are we?", "Raj: Sheldon, for God\u2019s sakes, don\u2019t make me beg.", "Sheldon: Bazinga! You\u2019ve fallen victim to another one of my classic practical jokes. I\u2019m your boss now. You may want to laugh at that.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Ah, it\u2019s nice having the place to ourselves, isn\u2019t it?", "Leonard: Uh-huh. Now that Raj is working for Sheldon, I don\u2019t have to chauffeur him around anymore. Plus, yeah, with them working late so much, we get some privacy.", "Penny: Mm-hmm. Hey, want to get a little crazy?", "Leonard: What are you thinking?", "Penny: Let\u2019s slide over to Sheldon\u2019s spot a make out.", "Leonard: You are a dirty girl.", "Penny (as the making out is interrupted by a knock on the door): Oh, God, how did he know?", "Howard: Hello.", "Leonard: Hi, Howard.", "Howard: Am I interrupting?", "Leonard: Little bit, yeah.", "Howard: Guess I should have called.", "Penny: Yeah, maybe.", "Howard: Tonight\u2019s the night I usually go line dancing with Raj at the palomino.", "Leonard: Uh-huh.", "Howard: But he\u2019s working with Sheldon.", "Penny: Yes, we know.", "Howard: Want me to leave?", "Leonard: You know, whatever.", "Howard: Okay, I guess I can hang for a little while. So what are we watching? Sex and the city.", "Yikes.", "Penny: Hey, I happen to love this movie.", "Howard: Fine, let\u2019s watch it. Maybe all our periods will synchronize.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office.", "Sheldon: All right, we\u2019re going to be designing an experiment to look for the annihilation spectrum resulting from dark matter collisions in space.", "Raj: Ooh, dark matter. We better bring a flashlight. I was making a joke.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m the boss. I make the jokes.", "Raj: Sorry, go ahead and make your joke.", "Sheldon: This is not the time for joking. We\u2019re doing serious research, which requires complete and utter focus.", "Raj: All right, let\u2019s buckle down and work.", "(To the tune of Eye of the Tiger by Survivor, there is a montage of images, in all of which Sheldon and Raj are staring at the same equation on a whiteboard.) ", "Raj: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: What?", "Raj: I need an aspirin.", "Sheldon: Top desk drawer.", "Raj: Thank you.", "Sheldon: Alright?", "Raj: Yes.", "Sheldon: Good.", "(Montage of scenes resumes) ", "\u00a0", "Scene: Penny and Leonard exiting Leonard\u2019s bedroom. ", "Leonard: That was fun. Thank you.", "Penny: Leonard, honey, you don\u2019t have to say thank you every time we have sex.", "Leonard: Oh. Okay. Tomorrow you\u2019re going to get a card in the mail. Just throw it away.", "Howard: Top o\u2019 the mornin\u2019o ya!", "Leonard: What are you doing here?", "Howard: Well, usually, on Sundays, I go with Raj to scam on hippie chicks at the farmers market, but he\u2019s still working with Sheldon, so I thought I\u2019d come over here and make you guys scrambled eggs and salami. It\u2019s the perfect meal for apres l\u2019amour.", "Penny: Oh, kill me.", "Howard: By the way, I couldn\u2019t help overhearing your big finish. Bravo, Leonard.", "Penny: See, if you had killed me when I said kill me, I wouldn\u2019t have had to hear that.", "Howard: What do you guys think? Want to take in a matinee, maybe go rollerblading, catch a step class?", "Penny: Do something.", "Leonard: Yeah, okay. Um, Howard, we need to talk.", "Howard: Sure. \u2018sup, homes?", "Leonard: Uh, please understand that it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t want you around, but Penny and I occasionally need some alone time.", "Howard: Oh. I get it, I\u2019m the third wheel. Sorry, I should have seen that. I\u2019ll get out of your way. Uh, you\u2019re gonna want to eat those eggs while they\u2019re still hot.", "Leonard: Thank you. There\u2019s lox and cream cheese in the fridge, the bagels are in the oven, I was warming them up.", "Penny: That\u2019s great.", "Howard: Ill just hang out with my mom. That\u2019s always fun.", "Leonard: Good.", "Penny: Are we terrible people?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. What do you want me to do?", "Penny: Get him, bring him back.", "Leonard: Are you sure?", "Penny: Yeah.", "Leonard: Okay. Howard come back.", "Howard: Oh, you guys had me scared for a minute.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s office. Sheldon is writing on the whiteboard.", "\u00a0", "Raj: No, no, no, no! That rate is much too low for what we\u2019d expect from this collision. Do you understand that we\u2019re talking about dark matter colliding in outer space?", "Sheldon: Of course I understand. And who are you to tell me about outer space?", "Raj: I\u2019m the astrophysicist. Astro means space.", "Sheldon: Astro means star.", "Raj: Okay, well, let me just tell you, if we were having this argument in my native language, I\u2019d be kicking your butt.", "Sheldon: English is your native language.", "Raj: Okay, you got me there, but you\u2019re wrong about this!", "Sheldon: There is a fine line between wrong and visionary. Unfortunately you have to be a visionary to see it.", "Raj: My god, you think that every thought that comes out of your head is pure gold. Well, let me tell you something. Some of those thoughts are pure caca.", "Sheldon: Caca?", "Raj: It means doo-doo.", "Sheldon: All right! First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I first proposed that you work with me\u2026", "Raj: Aha! So I am working with you.", "Sheldon: In this context, with me means for me.", "Raj: Ah, well, in this context\u2026 (blows raspberry)", "Sheldon: Oh! If I\u2019m wrong, prove it.", "Raj: Okay. Here\u2019s where we derive the mass of the dark matter particle.", "Sheldon: No, no, no, you\u2019ve misstated the atomic weight of the target.", "Raj: Let me finish.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re defacing my work.", "Raj: I\u2019m not defacing it, I\u2019m fixing it.", "Sheldon: Give me the eraser.", "Raj: No.", "Sheldon: I said give it to me.", "Raj: Come and get it.", "Sheldon: Fine. (Uses hand as an eraser. Then realises his hand is dirty) Oh, lord. Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior, I forbid you from writing on my board!", "Raj: You are not my superior.", "Sheldon: I am in every way.", "Raj: Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

Fails.)", "Scene: Outside Raj\u2019s flat.", "\u00a0", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj. (Knock, knock, knock) Raj.", "Raj: I\u2019m busy.", "Sheldon: Doing what? (Performs finger trick again) All right, you\u2019ve made your point.", "Raj: What do you want, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: I looked over the board and it turns out you were right.", "Raj: So you were wrong.", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t say that.", "Raj: That\u2019s the only logical inference.", "Sheldon: Nevertheless, I didn\u2019t say it. Anyway, I would like you to come back and work for me.", "Raj: For you or with you?", "Sheldon: In this context for me could mean with me.", "Raj: All right, but I have some conditions.", "Sheldon: I reject them all.", "Raj: I\u2019ll take the job. See you Monday.", "Sheldon: Wait, you have to drive me home.", "Raj: How did you get here?", "Sheldon: I walked.", "Raj: So walk home.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t. There\u2019s a big dog outside. On the way home, we can start thinking about methods of optimizing the detector for 500 GEV particles.", "Raj: All right.
