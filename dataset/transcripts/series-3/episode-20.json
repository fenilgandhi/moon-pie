{"series": "3", "episode": "20", "transcript": ["Scene: The lobby.", "Penny: Oh, damn, they cancelled my Visa. Oh, yay, a new MasterCard!", "Sheldon: Uh-oh.", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: I was going to get my mail.", "Penny: Okay. Are, are you hoping to get it telepathically?", "Sheldon: I think you mean telekinetically. And no, I just wasn\u2019t sure of the proper protocol now that you and Leonard are no longer having coitus.", "Penny: God, can we please just say no longer seeing each other?", "Sheldon: Well, we could if it were true. But as you live in the same building, you see each other all the time. The variable which has changed is the coitus.", "Penny: Okay, here\u2019s the protocol, you and I are still friends, and you stop saying coitus.", "Sheldon: Good, good. I\u2019m glad we\u2019re still friends.", "Penny: Really?", "Sheldon: Oh, yes. It was a lot of work to accommodate you in my life. I\u2019d hate for that effort to have been in vain.", "Penny: Right.", "Sheldon: Just to be clear do I have to stop saying coitus with everyone or just you?", "Penny: Everyone.", "Sheldon: Harsh terms. But all right, I\u2019ll just substitute intercourse.", "Penny: Great.", "Sheldon: Or fornication. Yeah. But that has judgmental overtones, so I\u2019ll hold that in reserve.", "Penny: So, how you been?", "Sheldon: Well, my existence is a continuum, so I\u2019ve been what I am at each point in the implied time period.", "Penny: You\u2019re just coitusing with me, aren\u2019t you?", "Sheldon: Bazinga.", "Penny: Mmm. How\u2019s Leonard doing?", "Sheldon: He seems all right. Although he does spend a disturbing amount of time looking at photographs of you and smelling the pillow you slept on. Oh, but now that I think of it, he asked me not to tell you that.", "Penny: I\u2019ll pretend I didn\u2019t hear it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019d rather you pretend I didn\u2019t say it. I see you bought Mama Italia marinara spaghetti sauce.", "Penny: Yep.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s the sauce my mother uses. She likes cooking Italian because according to her, that\u2019s what the Romans made Jesus eat.", "Penny: Interesting. I\u2019ll have to have you over for spaghetti some night.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m hungry now.", "Penny: Oh. Um, okay. Why don\u2019t you give me an hour and come over?", "Sheldon: Will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce?", "Penny: I don\u2019t have hot dogs.", "Sheldon: Oh, it\u2019s all right, I do. Oh! You\u2019re in for what my mother calls a real Eye-talian treat. (Enters apartment).", "Leonard: Hey, where you been?", "Sheldon: I was talking with Penny.", "Howard: What\u2019s wrong with you? You can\u2019t hang out with your roommate\u2019s ex. That\u2019s totally uncool.", "Leonard: No, no, it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m over it.", "Raj: Yeah, he\u2019s over it, that\u2019s why he\u2019s been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.", "Sheldon: Is he making any progress? Because I\u2019d like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.", "Howard: So would Ben Affleck. The point is, in a situation like this you got to pick sides. You\u2019re either on Team Leonard or Team Penny.", "Sheldon: Which one picks last?", "Howard: What?", "Sheldon: Well, usually I\u2019m on the team that picks last. Unless there\u2019s a kid in a wheelchair.", "Leonard: Sheldon, I got you your tangerine chicken. I hope you\u2019re hungry.", "Sheldon: Well, of course I\u2019m hungry. And as I have no plans to eat with any other team, I will consume my tangerine chicken with the appropriate gusto. Mm, mm, mm!", "Leonard: Okay.", "Sheldon: Just out of curiosity, do we still have hot dogs?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Why?", "Sheldon: Just making dinner conversation. Go, Team Leonard!", "Credits sequence", "\u00a0", "Scene: A few moments later.", "Howard: Oh, God, this is good.", "Raj: Let me ask you a question. Do you believe you\u2019re going to go to hell for eating sweet and sour pork?", "Howard: Jews don\u2019t have hell. We have acid reflux.", "Leonard: Do you want the last dumpling, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Certainly. It\u2019s not like I have to moderate my food intake because I\u2019m planning on eating again very shortly. Mm, mm, mm!", "Leonard: So, you guys want to do something tonight?", "Howard: Nah, I can\u2019t. I got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class. 18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool. Looks like the manatee tank at Sea World.", "Leonard: What about you, Raj?", "Raj: Oh, there it is, now that you don\u2019t have a girlfriend, you want to hang out with me again.", "Leonard: I never stopped hanging out with you.", "Raj: Oh, please, we all know I\u2019m the friend you call when you have no other options. If we were the Justice League, I\u2019d be Aquaman.", "Howard: I wish you were Aquaman. Then I could send you to scoop my mom out of the old lady tank.", "Sheldon: Excuse me, I\u2019m thirsty, so I\u2019m going to go to the refrigerator and get myself a refreshing beverage.", "Leonard: You know what? I\u2019ll just spend the evening alone.", "Raj: What, suddenly I\u2019m not good enough for you?", "Sheldon: Ah, I do so love beverages. Now I think I\u2019ll take my after-dinner walk.", "Leonard: Since when do you take after-dinner walks?", "Howard: Yeah, since when do you take walks?", "Sheldon: I read a study online that walking after a meal not only aids in digestion, but increases serotonin, and you know me, if there\u2019s one thing I like more than a refreshing beverage, it\u2019s serotonin. Bye-bye.", "Howard: Hold on. I\u2019ll walk down with you.", "Sheldon: Oh, that\u2019s not necessary. You can go first.", "Howard: Or we could go together.", "Sheldon: I can\u2019t think of a reason why not.", "Howard: Let\u2019s go.", "Sheldon: Hold on. Nope, no reason.", "Raj: I\u2019ve missed you.", "Scene: The lobby.", "Sheldon: All right, say hello to your mother for me.", "Howard: Okay.", "Sheldon: What?", "Howard: You said you were going for a walk.", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t say outside.", "Howard: So what, you\u2019re just gonna walk up and down the stairs?", "Sheldon: No, of course not. That would be odd and suspicious behavior.", "Woman\u2019s voice: Here Bubbles. Here boy.", "Howard: Which way are you going?", "Sheldon: Which way are you going?", "Howard: I parked my scooter down the block.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m going the other way. Bye.", "Howard: Bye. Actually, I\u2019m this way. Do I smell hot dogs?", "Sheldon: No. I mean, I have no idea what you smell.", "Howard: I definitely smell raw hot dog.", "Sheldon: Perhaps you\u2019re getting a brain tumour.", "Howard: All right, have a nice walk.", "Sheldon: I shall. Have a nice scoot.", "Howard: You might want to stand back. I\u2019m sitting on top of 13 horses here.", "Sheldon: Oh. Hello, doggie. Nice doggie. I bet you think you smell hot dogs. Look, a cat!", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Penny, (knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Long pause, knock, knock, knock) Penny. (Penny opens door. A dishevelled Sheldon is holding up one hot dog.) Here. I had to trade the others for my life.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Hey, Leonard?", "Leonard: Yeah?", "Raj: I haven\u2019t had sex in a year.", "Leonard: Where you going with this, Raj?", "Raj: Don\u2019t flatter yourself, dude. I want to go out and meet a woman.", "Leonard: So, go.", "Raj: Well, I need a wingman. I don\u2019t want to come off like a lonely loser.", "Leonard: And you think my presence will help with that?", "Raj: Well, I do. Next to you, I\u2019ll look like a catch.", "Leonard: I\u2019m not going out tonight, Raj.", "Raj: All right. Would you mind if I went to your room and downloaded some Asian pornography?", "Leonard: Very much.", "Raj: Doesn\u2019t have to be Asian.", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll meet a girl someday.", "Raj: No, I won\u2019t.", "Leonard: Yes, you will, and she\u2019ll be beautiful, and kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.", "Raj: You really think so?", "Leonard: I do, and you\u2019ll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart. And she\u2019ll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.", "Raj: But we\u2019ll have sex first, right?", "Scene: Penny\u2019s apartment.", "Sheldon: Mmm, mmm, mmm. That\u2019s Eye-talian.", "Penny: So, um, was Leonard okay with you coming over?", "Sheldon: Oh, yes. In fact, he said, I\u2019m fine, I don\u2019t care. And he in no way said it in a manner which would lead one to believe that he was covering up feelings of anguish and betrayal.", "Penny: Well, good.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m also pleased to report that he\u2019s all cried out over you.", "Penny: He\u2019s been crying?", "Sheldon: Oh, I believe that was something else I wasn\u2019t supposed to mention.", "Penny: Oh, God, I feel terrible.", "Sheldon: Do you have a stomach ache, too?", "Penny: No. Why, do you?", "Sheldon: No.", "Penny: Why did you ask if I had one, too?", "Sheldon: Just making polite dinner conversation. Your turn.", "Penny: All right. So, what\u2019s new in your life?", "Sheldon: Well, my new shoes are not made for running.", "Penny: Have you been running?", "Sheldon: No. It\u2019s just a suspicion I have. Mmm, mmm, mmm.", "Penny: I\u2019m so glad you like it.", "Sheldon: I do. Leonard never cooks for me.", "Penny: Well, maybe that\u2019s \u2019cause Leonard can\u2019t cook.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t cook and you made me this.", "Penny: Whatever. Ooh, I\u2019m gonna get the cheesecake out of the fridge.", "Sheldon: Oh, Lord, I\u2019m in Jewish hell.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Raj: Look at this. Do you think she\u2019s really doing that or is it PhotoShop?", "Leonard: I\u2019m pretty sure Martha Stewart never got naked with a room full of big, fat Japanese guys.", "Raj: You don\u2019t know that. Prison changes people.", "Leonard: Hey, where you been?", "Sheldon: I told you, walking.", "Leonard: For an hour and a half?", "Sheldon: I got lost.", "Leonard: How could you get lost? Your phone has GPS.", "Sheldon: Satellites are down. Solar flares.", "Raj: There are no solar flares right now.", "Sheldon: Yes, there are.", "Raj: Dude, I\u2019m an astrophysicist. If there were solar flares, I\u2019d be all up in it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sorry. I misspoke. What I meant to say was my battery died.", "Leonard: What the hell was that about?", "Raj: I don\u2019t know. Do you think this is really Hillary Clinton doing it with Oprah?", "Leonard: Oh, we really need to get you a girl.", "Scene: Leonard\u2019s bedroom. Leonard is asleep.", "Sheldon: (Knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard, (knock, knock, knock) Leonard.", "Leonard: Oh, just come in!", "Sheldon: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.", "Leonard: What do you want, Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Maybe this isn\u2019t a good time.", "Leonard: Tell me why you woke me up or I swear to God I will kill you.", "Sheldon: Do you really think death threats are an appropriate way to begin this conversation? Sometimes your lack of social skills astonishes me.", "Leonard: What do you want?", "Sheldon: You may want to sit down.", "Leonard: I\u2019m in bed!", "Sheldon: Point taken. You may want to sit up.", "Leonard: Sheldon!", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve been seeing Penny behind your back.", "Leonard: Okay, when you say seeing Penny, what exactly does that mean?", "Sheldon: We had dinner last night. She made me spaghetti with little hot dogs cut up in it. Well, little hot dog. I gave up the other five hot dogs to a real dog. A real, big dog. A hell hound. Tangential to the primary story. How about I circle back to it?", "Leonard: Fine. Why did you have dinner with Penny?", "Sheldon: I told you, she made spaghetti with little hot dogs. I like spaghetti with little hot dogs.", "Leonard: Then why did you have Chinese food with us?", "Sheldon: I didn\u2019t want to upset you. Howard made it very clear that my allegiance should be to male comrades before women who sell their bodies for money.", "Leonard: Is it possible he said Bros before Hos?", "Sheldon: Yes, but I rephrased it to avoid offending the hos.", "Leonard: Sheldon, I don\u2019t care if you want to be friends with Penny.", "Sheldon: Oh. Well, so the emotional turmoil that\u2019s been keeping me from achieving REM sleep was entirely unjustified?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: Well then as my meemaw would say, looks like we butchered a pig, but nobody wanted bacon.", "Leonard: I guess not.", "Sheldon: And now, as promised, the tangent. Sheldon and the Hell Hound, or How I Lost My Hot Dogs.", "Scene: The laundry room.", "Penny: Oh, um, I, I can come back.", "Leonard: D-don\u2019t be silly. We\u2019re neighbours, we\u2019re going to run into each other, may as well get used to it.", "Penny: Yeah, I guess you\u2019re right.", "Leonard: You used to it yet?", "Penny: Nope.", "Leonard: Me neither. Oh, Sheldon seemed think that I would be upset about you hanging out with him. But I just want you to know it\u2019s fine.", "Penny: Oh, oh, good, because, um, his mother called me.", "Leonard: His mother?", "Penny: Yeah, she wants me to take him shopping for sheets and towels.", "Leonard: I was going to do that.", "Penny: Oh, well, then you, you do it.", "Leonard: No, I don\u2019t want to do it. You can do it.", "Penny: Okay, you can take him for shoes.", "Leonard: I just took him for shoes.", "Penny: Well, all I know is he says they hurt his feet.", "Leonard: Fine. I\u2019ll take him for shoes next Saturday.", "Penny: Oh, no, no, no, a bunch of us from work are going to Disneyland next Saturday and Sheldon wants to come.", "Leonard: You\u2019re taking him to Disneyland?", "Penny: Well, he heard me making plans on the phone. Was I going to say no?", "Leonard: All right. But let me know if you\u2019re going to stuff him with junk food. I don\u2019t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste.", "Penny: We\u2019re going to Disneyland. He\u2019s going to eat junk food.", "Leonard: All I\u2019m saying is give me a heads-up.", "Penny: Okay, whatever.", "Leonard: And don\u2019t let him go on Space Mountain after he eats. He\u2019ll say he can handle it, but I promise you\u2019ll end up with churro puke on your shoes.", "Penny: All right, got it. Is there anything else?", "Leonard: Yeah, don\u2019t let Goofy near him. He\u2019ll have nightmares and I\u2019ll have to deal with it.", "Penny: What\u2019s the problem with Goofy?", "Leonard: Wish I knew. He\u2019s fine with Pluto.", "Scene: The apartment. ", "Raj: Hey, do you think the elastic woman in The Incredibles needs to use birth control or can she just be a diaphragm?", "Howard: Well, that\u2019s it. We\u2019re officially out of things to talk about.", "Penny: We\u2019re home.", "Leonard: It\u2019s ten o\u2019clock, where have you been?", "Sheldon: We stayed for the California Adventure water show. It was pure Disney magic.", "Leonard: I was going to see that with him.", "Penny: How was I supposed to know that?", "Sheldon: It\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll see it again with you.", "Leonard: And I have food here. You said you were going to call.", "Penny: I know, I know.", "Sheldon: I can still eat.", "Penny: No, you already threw up once. Go put on your PJs and brush your teeth.", "Sheldon: Okay, but just don\u2019t fight", "Leonard: We\u2019re not fighting.", "Penny: Just go.", "Leonard: Aren\u2019t you going to thank Penny for taking you to Disneyland?", "Sheldon: Thank you, Penny.", "Penny: You\u2019re welcome, sweetie.", "Leonard: Want a cup of coffee?", "Penny: Oh, um, I should probably get going.", "Leonard: Come on. It\u2019s just a cup of coffee.", "Penny: Yep, okay.", "Howard (to Raj, who has whispered to him): Oh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too.", "Leonard: What am I smelling?", "Penny: Sheldon\u2019s churro on my shoes.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Penny: He\u2019s such an angel when he\u2019s asleep.", "Leonard: Yeah. Shame he has to wake up.", "Penny: I think we can do it.", "Leonard: Smother Sheldon in his sleep? Wouldn\u2019t that be wrong?", "Penny: No, be friends. You and me.", "Leonard: Oh. Sure. Absolutely.", "Penny: Good. I\u2019m glad.", "Leonard: Here\u2019s an idea. I\u2019m just throwing it out there, friends who have sex.", "Penny: Good night, Leonard.", "Leonard: Kidding. Just a couple of friends goofin\u2019 around.", "Sheldon (in his sleep): No, Goofy, no."]}
