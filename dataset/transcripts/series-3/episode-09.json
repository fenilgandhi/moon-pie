You\u2019re like a stand-up comedian.", "Howard: A Jewish stand-up comedian, that\u2019d be new.", "Bernadette: Actually, I think a lot of them are Jewish.", "Howard: No, I was just\u2026 never mind.", "Bernadette: Look, Howard, this is our third date and we both know what that means.", "Howard: We do?", "Bernadette: Sex.", "Howard: You\u2019re kidding.", "Bernadette: But I need to know whether you\u2019re looking for a relationship or a one-night stand.", "Howard: Okay, just to be clear, there\u2019s only one correct answer, right? It\u2019s not like chicken or fish on an airplane?", "Bernadette: Maybe you need to think about it a little.", "Howard: You know, it\u2019s not unheard of for a one-night stand to turn into a relationship.", "Bernadette: Call me when you figure it out.", "Howard: Three dates means sex? Who knew?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Howard: Greetings, homies, homette.", "Penny: Why are you back from your date so early?", "Howard: In romance, as in show business, always leave them wanting more.", "Penny: What exactly does that mean?", "Leonard: He struck out.", "Credits sequence. ", "\u00a0", "Scene: The university cafeteria.", "Howard: Hey, did either of you guys know that three dates with the same woman is the threshold for sex?", "Raj: Actually, I\u2019ve never had three dates with the same woman.", "Leonard: With Penny and me, it took two years. Now that I think about it, that was three dates.", "Howard: Okay, well, before you and Penny hooked up, did she ask for any kind of commitment?", "Leonard: No, she was pretty clear about wanting to keep her options open.", "Sheldon (arriving): I have something to announce, but out of respect for convention, I will wait for you to finish your current conversation. What are you talking about?", "Leonard: The cultural paradigm in which people have sex after three dates.", "Sheldon: I see. Now, are we talking date, the social interaction, or date, the dried fruit?", "Leonard: Never mind, what\u2019s your announcement?", "Sheldon: Oh, good, my turn. Well, this is very exciting and I wanted you to be among the first to know\u2026", "Kripke: Hey, Cooper, I hear you\u2019re going to be on the wadio with Ira Fwatow from Science Fwiday next week.", "Sheldon: Thank you, Kripke, for depriving me of the opportunity to share my news with my friends.", "Kripke: My pweasure.", "Sheldon: My thank you was not sincere.", "Kripke: But my pweasure is. Let me ask you a question, at what point did National Public Wadio have to start scwaping the bottom of the bawwel for its guests? Eh, don\u2019t answer, it\u2019s wetowical.", "Sheldon: Why are you such a stupid head? That is also rhetorical. I\u2019m sorry you had to hear that.", "Leonard: Are you really going to be on NPR?", "Sheldon: Yes, they\u2019re interviewing me by phone from my office, regarding the recent so-called discovery of magnetic monopoles in spin-ices. It\u2019s pledge week and they\u2019re trying to goose the ratings with a little controversy.", "Leonard: Very cool, congratulations.", "Sheldon: Thank you. My mother is very excited. She\u2019s convening her Bible study group to listen in, and then pray for my soul.", "Raj: I was on the radio once. I called in to Fever 104 FM New Delhi and was the fourth person to say the phrase that pays, \u201cFever 104, \u0906\u091c \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u092f\u0947 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0947 \u0938\u0902\u0917\u0940\u0924 \u0915\u093e \u0918\u0930.\u201d That means: \u201cFever 104, home of the really good current music.\u201d It\u2019s much catchier in Hindi.", "Scene: The apartment.", "Sheldon: All right. These are the talking points for my NPR interview tomorrow. I need to make sure that they\u2019re simple enough for the less educated in the audience to understand. Howard, look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.", "Howard: Excuse me, I have a master\u2019s degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It required the completion of 144 units of grad work and an original thesis.", "Sheldon: Yes. Look this over and tell me what\u2019s unclear to you.", "Leonard: You know, when Sheldon gives you homework, you don\u2019t have to do it.", "Raj: In fact, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t, otherwise it makes the rest of us look bad.", "Penny: Hi, guys.", "Leonard: Hey.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Penny: Yo, Raj, talk to me. I\u2019m sorry, just screwing with you. Hey, Howard, why haven\u2019t you called Bernadette?", "Howard: Did she say something?", "Penny: Yeah, she said she hasn\u2019t heard from you in a week. I thought you liked her?", "Howard: I do, yeah, but she wants a commitment and I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s my type.", "Penny: She agreed to go out with you for free. What more do you need?", "Howard: Look, Bernadette is really nice. I just always thought when I finally settle down into a relationship, it would be with someone, you know, different.", "Penny: Different how?", "Howard: Well, you know, more like Megan Fox from Transformers, or Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica.", "Penny: Are you high?", "Leonard: You\u2019d have a better shot with the three-breasted Martian hooker from Total Recall.", "Howard: Okay, now you\u2019re just being unrealistic. Anyway, that movie was like 20 years ago, imagine how saggy those things would be.", "Penny: Howard, you\u2019re going to throw away a great girl like Bernadette because you\u2019re holding out for some ridiculous fantasy?", "Howard: Hey, just because you settled doesn\u2019t mean I have to.", "Leonard: Excuse me, I\u2019m sitting here.", "Penny: Hey, I did not settle for Leonard. I mean, obviously, he isn\u2019t the kind of guy I usually go out with, you know, physically.", "Leonard: Again, I\u2019m right here.", "Penny: My point is, I do not judge a book by its cover. I am interested in the person underneath.", "Leonard: I am here, right? You see me.", "Howard: Hey, I\u2019m interested in what\u2019s inside people, too, but why is it wrong to want those insides wrapped up in, say, the delicious caramel that is Halle Berry? (To Raj) Yes, you\u2019re delicious caramel, too.", "Penny: All right, you know what, I will tell you why it\u2019s wrong\u2026", "Sheldon: Excuse me, may I interject?", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.", "Howard: Thank you, Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Now, whether that propagation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.", "Scene: Kripke is in a storage cupboard of some kind. He has tubes rigged up through the roof attached to helium tanks which he is turning on. The radio is playing. ", "Radio: This is Ira Flatow and you\u2019re listening to NPR\u2019s Science Friday. Joining us today by phone from his office in Pasadena, California is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.", "Kripke: Oh, this is going to be a wiot.", "Scene switches to Sheldon\u2019s office, where the end of the tubing can be seen coming through the wall. Hissing can be heard.", "Radio: Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Cooper.", "Sheldon: My pleasure, Ira.", "Ira: Now, let\u2019s talk about magnetic monopoles. Can you explain to our audience just what a monopole is?", "Sheldon: Of course. First, consider an ordinary magnet which has, (the pitch of his voice begins to rise) as even the most uneducated in your audience must know, two poles, (pitch rises further) a north and south pole. If you cut that in half, you have two smaller magnets, each with its own north and south pole.", "Ira: Uh, Dr. Cooper, I think there might be something wrong with our connection.", "Sheldon (even higher pitch): No, I hear you fine. As I was saying, an ordinary magnet has two poles. The primary characteristic of a monopole is that it has only one pole, hence, monopole.", "Scene cuts to university cafeteria where Kripke is holding up the radio for all to listen. ", "Sheldon: A requirement for string theory, or M-theory, if you will, is the existence of such monopoles. I, myself, led an expedition to the Arctic Circle in search of said particles. Kripke, I found the nozzle! I\u2019m going to kill you!", "Scene: Howard\u2019s bathroom. He is in the bath.", "Howard: So nice you could join me this evening. You\u2019re looking lovely as always.", "Katee Sackhoff: Thanks, Howard. Always nice to be part of your masturbatory fantasies.", "Howard: Come on, Katee, don\u2019t make it sound so cheap.", "Katee: I\u2019m sorry, fiddling with yourself in the bathtub is a real class act.", "Howard: Thank you. So, shall we get started?", "Katee: Sure. But can I ask you a question first?", "Howard: You want to play Cylon and colonist?", "Katee: No. I want to know why you\u2019re playing make-believe with me when you could be out with a real woman tonight.", "Howard: You mean, Bernadette?", "Katee: No, I mean Princess Leia. Of course I mean Bernadette. She\u2019s a wonderful girl and she really likes you.", "Howard: I know, but she\u2019s not you.", "Katee: I\u2019m not me. The real me is in Beverly Hills going out with a tall, handsome, rich guy.", "Howard: Really? Tall?", "Katee: Six-four.", "Howard: Ouch.", "Katee: The point is, you\u2019ve got a wonderful girl in your life, and you\u2019re ignoring her in order to spend your nights in the bathtub with a mental image and a wash cloth.", "Howard\u2019s Mother: Howard! What are you doing in there?", "Howard: I\u2019m taking a bath!", "Howard\u2019s Mother: I hope that\u2019s all you\u2019re doing! We share that tub!", "Howard: Don\u2019t remind me! (Katee has vanished) Oh, man. All soaped up and no place to go.", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. ", "Leonard: How ya doin\u2019, buddy?", "Sheldon: I was humiliated on national radio. How do you think I\u2019m doing?", "Leonard: Come on, it wasn\u2019t that bad.", "Sheldon: What do you want?", "Raj (in a munchkin voice): We represent the Lollipop Guild, and we want you.", "Leonard: Okay, so Kripke played a joke on you.", "Sheldon: It wasn\u2019t funny.", "Raj: I thought it was funny.", "Leonard: Raj.", "Raj: You laughed.", "Sheldon: Did you laugh?", "Leonard: I fell on the floor. All right, he got you, you can get him back.", "Sheldon: I refuse to sink to his level.", "Raj: You can\u2019t sink. With all that helium in you, you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t float away.", "Leonard: Are you really admitting defeat?", "Sheldon: I never admit defeat.", "Leonard: Good.", "Sheldon: However, on an unrelated topic, I am never getting out of this bed again.", "Leonard: What if you could make Kripke look even sillier than he made you look?", "Raj: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible, dude.", "Leonard: You\u2019re not helping.", "Raj: I didn\u2019t come to help, I came to mock.", "Leonard: Sheldon, what you need to do is figure out a way to exact vengeance on Kripke, like, uh, like, how the Joker got back at Batman for putting him in the Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane.", "Raj: That\u2019s true. He didn\u2019t just stay there and talk about his feelings with the other psychotic villains. He, he broke out and poisoned Gotham\u2019s water supply.", "Sheldon: Well, I suppose I could poison Kripke.", "Leonard: No, no.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s a simple matter. There are several toxic chemicals that\u2019d be untraceable in an autopsy.", "Leonard: Okay, uh, that\u2019s the spirit, but, um, let\u2019s dial it back to a non-lethal form of vengeance.", "Sheldon: Oh! How about we put awhoopee cushion on his office chair? He\u2019ll sit down, it\u2019ll sound like he\u2019s flatulent, even though he\u2019s not.", "Leonard: Let\u2019s keep thinking.", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory. Howard enters.", "Penny: Oh, gee, you\u2019re too late. Scarlett Johansson and Wonder Woman were just in here trolling around for neurotic, little weasels.", "Howard: Yeah, I came to talk to Bernadette. She\u2019s working today, right?", "Penny: Yes, but I don\u2019t think she wants to see you.", "Howard: Why not?", "Penny: Come on, Howard. You hurt her feelings by not calling her all week. Plus, I\u2019ve kind of been talkin\u2019 some smack about ya.", "Bernadette: Hello, Howard.", "Howard: Wait, Bernadette, I need to talk to you.", "Bernadette: I can\u2019t now, I\u2019m working.", "Howard: This will only take a second. You asked me to think about where our relationship was going, and I did. Bernadette? Will you marry me?", "Bernadette: Is this more comedy that I don\u2019t understand?", "Howard: No. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m never going to find another girl like you who likes me and is, you know, real.", "Bernadette: So, this isn\u2019t a joke?", "Howard: No.", "Bernadette: Then you\u2019re insane.", "Howard: I prefer to think of myself as quirky.", "Bernadette: Howard, we\u2019ve only been on three dates. We haven\u2019t even had sex yet.", "Howard: Fair enough. When\u2019s your break?", "Bernadette: Wow. (Walks away)", "Howard: Don\u2019t you just hate when this happens?", "Penny: Wow.", "Scene: The apartment kitchen.", "Sheldon: All right, how\u2019s this for revenge? A solution of hydrogen peroxide, and one of saturated potassium iodide.", "Raj: What\u2019s this?", "Sheldon: Mountain Dew. Ah, refreshing. Now, we\u2019re going to combine these chemicals with ordinary dish soap, creating a little exothermic release of oxygen.", "Raj: Foamy vengeance.", "Sheldon: Yes, exactly.", "Leonard: This is brilliant, Sheldon. How are we going to deploy it in Kripke\u2019s office?", "Sheldon: Already taken care of. Observe. This is a live shot of Kripke\u2019s lab via a mini webcam I was able to install, thanks to a dollar bill discreetly placed in the night janitor\u2019s shirt pocket. At the same time, I also secured large quantities of these chemicals above the tiles in the drop ceiling.", "Raj: Oh, Sheldon, you remind me of a young Lex Luthor.", "Sheldon: You flatter me, sir.", "Leonard: Let me guess, motion sensors?", "Sheldon: The reaction will be triggered when Kripke reaches the center of the room. Mwah, ha, ha.", "Leonard: I gotta say, I am really impressed. This is truly the Sheldon Cooper way to get even. (Sits down. There is a flatulent noise)", "Sheldon: It may be low-tech, but I still maintain the whoopee cushion has comic validity.", "Raj: Here comes Kripke!", "Leonard: Who is that with him?", "Raj: I believe that\u2019s the president of the university.", "Leonard: And the board of directors. Abort! Abort!", "Sheldon: There is no abort.", "Raj: Well, how could you not put in an abort?", "Sheldon: I made a boo-boo, all right?", "Kripke: I think the board will weally appweciate how well we\u2019re using that NSA gwant, Pwesident Seibert. Wight here we have a micwo-contwolled pwasma\u2026 (foam falls from the ceiling soaking everyone)", "Raj: Wow. Looks like the Ganges on laundry day.", "Leonard: At least they don\u2019t know it was you.", "Sheldon (on Kripke\u2019s computer in the lab): Hello, Kripke. This classic prank comes to you from the malevolent mind of Sheldon Cooper. If you\u2019d like to see the look on your stupid face, this video is being instantly uploaded to YouTube. Oh, and a hat tip to Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali for their support and encouragement in this enterprise.", "Raj: Well, I\u2019m going back to India. What\u2019s your plan?", "Scene: The Cheesecake Factory.", "\u00a0", "Penny: Hey, here\u2019s your tip from table seven.", "Bernadette: Oh, thanks.", "Penny: Mm-hmm.", "Howard (on the stage, into a microphone): Testing. Check. Check two.", "Bernadette: Oh, now what?", "Penny: You want me to throw him out?", "Bernadette: No, that\u2019s okay.", "Penny: Are you sure? He\u2019s small. I bet I can get a nice, tight spiral on him.", "Howard: I want to dedicate this number to a great gal who I\u2019ve done wrong. (To the tune of the Four Tops song Bernadette)  Bernadette, I am so sorry for trying to propose to you, Bernadette, you found it creepy but that\u2019s just the kind of thing I do. I know now it was too soon to talk of love. It was just a crazy idea that came to me in my tub. But, Bernadette, give me one more chance, sweet Bernadette, I\u2019ll get the hang of this thing they call romance, sweet Bernadette, I dream to once again kiss your lips, sweet Bernadette. Sincerely yours, Howard Wolowitz, Bernadette\u2026", "Penny: Oh, I am so sorry.", "Bernadette: Are you kidding? That\u2019s the most romantic thing anyone\u2019s ever done for me.", "Howard (still singing): \u2026Bernadette! Thank you, Cheesecake Factory!"]}
