", "Penny: So, how was paintball, did you have fun?", "Sheldon: Sure, if you consider being fragged by your own troops fun. (To Howard) You clear space on your calendar, there will be an enquiry.", "Penny: Okay, um, oh hey, I\u2019m having a party on Saturday so if you guys are around you should come by.", "Leonard: A party? ", "Penny: Yeah.", "Howard: A boy-girl party?", "Penny: Well, there will be boys, and there will be girls, and it is a party. So, it\u2019ll just be a bunch of my friends, we\u2019ll have some beer, do a little dancing\u2026", "Sheldon: Dancing?", "Leonard: Yeah, I don\u2019t know, Penny\u2026", "Sheldon: The thing is, we\u2019re not\u2026.", "Leonard: We\u2019re really more\u2026.", "Sheldon: No.", "Leonard: But thanks, thanks for thinking of us.", "Penny: Are you sure? Come on, it\u2019s Halloween.", "Sheldon: A Halloween party?", "Howard: As in, costumes? ", "Penny: Well, yeah. ", "Leonard: Is there a theme?", "Penny: Um, yeah, Halloween.", "Sheldon: Yes, but are the costumes random, or genre specific? ", "Penny: As usual, I\u2019m not following.", "Leonard: He\u2019s asking if we can come as anyone from science-fiction, fantasy\u2026", "Penny: Sure.", "Sheldon: What about comic-books?", "Penny: Fine.", "Sheldon: Anime?", "Penny: Of course.", "Sheldon: TV , film, D&D, Manga, Greek Gods, Roman Gods, Norse Gods\u2026", "Penny: Anything you want, okay? Any costume you want. Bye. ", "Howard: Gentlemen, to the sewing machines.", "Credits Sequence", "Scene: The apartment living room. There is a knock on the door.", "Leonard (off): I\u2019ll get it. (He enters, wearing a Flash costume. Opens door.)", "Howard (Entering at speed, also wearing a Flash costume): Bjow (They stare at each other in shock.)", "Leonard: Oh, no. ", "Sheldon: Oh no! (He is also wearing a Flash costume.)", "Raj: Make way for the fastest man alive. (Enters, also in a Flash costume.) Oh no!", "Sheldon: See, this is why I wanted to have a costume meeting. ", "Leonard: We all have other costumes, we can change.", "Raj: Or, we could walk right behind each other all night and look like one person going really fast. ", "Howard: No, no, no, it\u2019s a boy-girl party, this Flash runs solo. ", "Leonard: Okay, how about this, nobody gets to be The Flash, we all change, agreed?", "All: Agreed. ", "Leonard: I call Frodo!", "All: Damn!", "Scene: The same, later. Leonard is dressed as Frodo. Howard appears to be Peter Pan. There is a knock on the door.", "Raj (Entering dressed as Thor): Hey. Sorry I\u2019m late, but my hammer got stuck in the door on the bus.", "Leonard: You went with Thor?", "Raj: What? Just because I\u2019m Indian I can\u2019t be a Norse God? No, no, no, Raj has to be an Indian God. That\u2019s racism. I mean, look at Wolowitz, he\u2019s not English, but he\u2019s dressed like Peter Pan. Sheldon(entering in a body suit featuring black and white vertical lines) is neither sound nor light, but he\u2019s obviously the Doppler Effect. ", "Howard: I\u2019m not Peter Pan, I\u2019m Robin Hood. ", "Raj: Really, because I saw Peter Pan, and you\u2019re dressed exactly like Cathy Rigby. She was a little bigger than you, but it\u2019s basically the same look, man. ", "Leonard: Hey, Sheldon, there\u2019s something I want to talk to you about before we go to the party.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t care if anybody gets it, I\u2019m going as the Doppler Effect. ", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s not\u2026", "Sheldon: If I have to, I can demonstrate. Neeeeoooowwwww!", "Leonard: Terrific. Um, this party is my first chance for Penny to see me in the context of her social group, and I need you not to embarrass me tonight. ", "Sheldon: Well, what exactly do you mean by embarrass you?", "Leonard: For example, tonight no-one needs to know that my middle name is Leakey. ", "Sheldon: Well, there\u2019s nothing embarrassing about that, your father worked with Lewis Leakey, a great anthropologist. It had nothing to do with your bed-wetting. ", "Leonard: All I\u2019m saying is that this party is the perfect opportunity for Penny to see me as a member of her peer group. A potential close friend and\u2026 perhaps more. I don\u2019t want to look like a dork. ", "Scene: The hallway. Howard knocks on Penny\u2019s door with his bow. ", "Howard: Just a heads up fellas, if anyone gets lucky I\u2019ve got a dozen condoms in my quiver. ", "Penny (opening door, not in costume): Oh, hey guys. ", "Leonard: Hey, sorry we\u2019re late. ", "Penny: Late? It\u2019s 7:05.", "Sheldon: And you said the party starts at seven. ", "Penny: Well, yeah, when you start a party at seven, no-one shows up at, you know, seven. ", "Sheldon: It\u2019s 7:05. ", "Penny: Yes. Yes it is. Okay, well, um, come on in. ", "Howard: What, are all the girls in the bathroom?", "Penny: Probably, but in their own homes. ", "Sheldon: So what time does the costume parade start? ", "Penny: The parade?", "Sheldon: Yeah, so the judges can give out the prizes for best costume, you know, most frightening, most authentic, most accurate visual representation of a scientific principle.", "Penny: Oh, Sheldon, I\u2019m sorry but there aren\u2019t going to be any parades or judges or prizes. ", "Sheldon: This party is just going to suck. ", "Penny: No, come on, it\u2019s going to be fun, and you all look great, I mean, look at you, Thor, and, oh, Peter Pan, that\u2019s so cute.", "Leonard: Actually, Penny, he\u2019s Rob\u2026", "Howard: I\u2019m Peter Pan! And I\u2019ve got a handful of pixie dust with your name on it. ", "Penny: No you don\u2019t. Oh, hey, what\u2019s Sheldon supposed to be.", "Leonard: Oh, he\u2019s the Doppler Effect.", "Sheldon: Yes. It\u2019s the apparent change in the frequency of a wave caused by relative motion between the source of the wave and the observer. ", "Penny: Oh, sure, I see it now, the Doppler Effect. Alright, I\u2019ve got to shower, you guys um, make yourselves comfortable. ", "Leonard: Okay. ", "Sheldon: See, people get it. ", "Time shift, the party is in full swing, the four guys are sitting together around the coffee table. ", "Raj: Mmmm, by Odin\u2019s beard, this is good Chex Mix. ", "Howard: No thanks, peanuts, I can\u2019t afford to swell up in these tights. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019m confused. If there\u2019s no costume parade, what are we doing here? ", "Leonard: We\u2019re socialising. Meeting new people. ", "Sheldon: Telepathically?", "Penny (crossing the room in a cat costume, speaking to someone off-screen): Oh hey, when did you get here, Hi!", "Raj: Penny is wearing the worst Catwoman costume I have ever seen, and that includes Halle Berry\u2019s.", "Leonard: She\u2019s not Catwoman, she\u2019s just a generic cat.", "Sheldon: And that\u2019s the kind of sloppy costuming which results from a lack of rules and competition.", "Howard: Hey guys, check out the sexy nurse. I believe it\u2019s time for me to turn my head and cough. ", "Raj: What is your move?", "Howard: I\u2019m going to use the mirror technique. She brushes her hair back, I brush my hair back, she shrugs, I shrug, subconsciously she\u2019s thinking we\u2019re in sync, we belong together.", "Leonard: Where do you get this stuff?", "Howard: You know, psychology journals, internet research, and there\u2019s this great show on VH1 about how to pick up girls. ", "Raj: Oh, if only I had his confidence. I have such difficulty speaking to women. Or around women. Or at times, even effeminate men. ", "Howard: If that\u2019s a working stethoscope, maybe you\u2019d like to hear my heart skip a beat.", "Nurse Costume Girl: No thanks.", "Howard: No, seriously, you can, I have transient idiopathic arrhythmia.", "Leonard: I\u00a0 want to get to know Penny\u2019s friends, I just, I don\u2019t know how to talk to these people. ", "Sheldon: Well, I actually might be able to help.", "Leonard: How so?", "Sheldon: Like Jane Goodall observing the apes, I initially saw their interactions as confusing and unstructured, but patterns emerge, they have their own language if you will. ", "Leonard: Go on.", "Sheldon: Well, it seems that the newcomer approaches the existing group with the greeting \u201cHow wasted am I?\u201d which is met with an approving chorus of \u201cDude.\u201d", "Leonard: Then what happens?", "Sheldon: That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ve gotten.", "Leonard: This is ridiculous, I\u2019m jumping in.", "Sheldon: Good luck. ", "Leonard: No, you\u2019re coming with me.", "Sheldon: Oh, I hardly think so. ", "Leonard: Come on.", "Sheldon: Aren\u2019t you afraid I\u2019ll embarrass you?", "Leonard: Yes. But I need a wing-man.", "Sheldon: Alright, but if we\u2019re going to use flight metaphors I\u2019m much more suited to being the guy from the FAA, analysing wreckage. ", "Girl in Hippie Costume: Oh, Hi!", "Leonard: Hi.", "Sheldon: Hello.", "Girl: So, what are you supposed to be?", "Sheldon: Me? I\u2019ll give you a hint. Neeeeooooowwwww!", "Girl: Uh, a choo-choo train?", "Sheldon: Close! Neeeeeoooooowwwww!", "Girl: A brain damaged choo-choo train?", "Girl in Butterfly Costume (dropping onto sofa next to Raj): How wasted am I? (Raj shrugs.)", "Time shift. Sheldon and Leonard are now talking to a girl in a princess costume.", "Sheldon: Neeeeeooooowwwwww!", "Girl: I still don\u2019t get it.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m the Doppler Effect. ", "Girl: Okay, if that is some sort of learning disability, I think it\u2019s very insensitive.", "Leonard: Why don\u2019t you just tell people you\u2019re a zebra?", "\u00a0Sheldon: Well, why don\u2019t you just tell people you\u2019re one of the seven dwarves. ", "Leonard: Because I\u2019m Frodo.", "Sheldon: Yes, well, I\u2019m the Doppler Effect. ", "Leonard: Oh no.", "Sheldon: What?", "Leonard: That\u2019s Penny\u2019s ex-boyfriend.", "Sheldon: What do you suppose he\u2019s doing here? Besides disrupting the local gravity field. ", "Leonard: If he were any bigger, he\u2019d have moons orbiting him.", "Sheldon: Oh, snap. So I guess we\u2019ll be leaving now. ", "Leonard: Why should we leave? For all we know, he crashed the party and Penny doesn\u2019t even want him here. (Penny and Kurt hug).", "Sheldon: You have a back-up hypothesis. ", "Leonard: Maybe they just want to be friends. ", "Sheldon: Or maybe she wants to be friends, and he wants something more. ", "Leonard: Then he and I are on equal ground.", "Sheldon: Yes, but you\u2019re much closer to it than he is. ", "Leonard: Look, if this was 15,000 years ago, by virtue of his size and strength, Kurt would be entitled to his choice of female partners.", "Sheldon: And male partners. Animal partners. Large primordial eggplants, pretty much whatever tickled his fancy. ", "Leonard: Yes, but our society has undergone a paradigm shift, in the information age, Sheldon, you and I are the alpha males. We shouldn\u2019t have to back down. ", "Sheldon: True. Why don\u2019t you text him that and see if he backs down?", "Leonard: No. I\u2019m going to assert my dominance face to face. ", "Sheldon: Face to face? Are you going to wait for him to sit down, or are you going to stand on a coffee table?", "Leonard: Hello Penny. Hello Kurt.", "Penny: Oh, hey guys. You having a good time?", "Sheldon: Given the reaction to my costume, this party is a scathing indictment of the American education system. ", "Kurt: What, you\u2019re a zebra, right?", "Sheldon: Yet another child left behind. ", "Kurt: And what are you supposed to be, an Elf?", "Leonard: No, I\u2019m a Hobbit.", "Kurt: What\u2019s the difference? ", "Leonard: Uh, a Hobbit is a mortal Halfling inhabitant of Middle Earth, whereas an Elf is an immortal tall warrior. ", "Kurt: So why the hell would you want to be a Hobbit?", "Sheldon: Because he is neither tall nor immortal, and none of us could be The Flash. ", "Kurt: Well, whatever, why don\u2019t you go hop off on a quest, I\u2019m talking to Penny here.", "Leonard: I think we\u2019re all talking to Penny here.", "Sheldon: I\u2019m not. No offence. ", "Kurt: Okay, maybe you didn\u2019t hear me, go away.", "Penny: Alright Kurt, be nice.", "Kurt: Aw, I am being nice. Right little buddy.", "Penny: Kurt!", "Leonard: Okay, I understand your impulse to try to physically intimidate me. I mean, you can\u2019t compete with me on an intellectual level and so you\u2019re driven to animalistic puffery. ", "Kurt: Are you calling me a puffy animal?", "Penny: Of course not, no, he\u2019s not, you\u2019re not, right Leonard? ", "Leonard: No, I said animalistic. Of course we\u2019re all animals, but some of us have climbed a little higher on the evolutionary tree. ", "Sheldon: If he understands that, you\u2019re in trouble. ", "Kurt: So what, I\u2019m unevolved?", "Sheldon: You\u2019re in trouble. ", "Kurt: You know, you use a lot of big words for such a little dwarf. ", "Penny: Okay, Kurt, please.", "Leonard: No, Penny, it\u2019s okay, I can handle this. I\u2019m not a dwarf, I\u2019m a Hobbit. A Hobbit. Are misfiring neurons in your hippocampus preventing the conversion from short-term to long-term memory?", "Kurt: Okay, now you\u2019re starting to make me mad. ", "Leonard: A homo-habilus discovering his opposable thumbs says what?", "Kurt: What?", "Leonard: I think I\u2019ve made my point.", "Kurt: Yeah, how about I make a point out of your pointy little head.", "Sheldon: Let me remind you, while my moral support is absolute, in a physical confrontation I will be less than useless. ", "Leonard: There\u2019s not going to be a confrontation, in fact I doubt if he can even spell confrontation.", "Kurt (physically lifting Leonard from the ground): C \u2013 O \u2013 N\u2026 frontation!", "Penny: Kurt, put him down this instant. ", "Kurt: He started it.", "Penny: I don\u2019t care, I\u2019m finishing it, put him down. ", "Kurt: Fine. You\u2019re one lucky little leprechaun. ", "Sheldon: He\u2019s a Hobbit! I\u2019ve got your back. ", "Penny: Leonard, are you okay.", "Leonard: Yeah, no, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s good, it\u2019s a good party, thanks for having us, it\u2019s just getting a little late so\u2026.", "Penny: Oh, okay, alright, well thank you for coming. ", "Sheldon: Happy Halloween. (They leave) If it\u2019s any consolation, I thought that homo-habilus line really put him in his place. ", "Scene: The living room. Sheldon brings Leonard a cup of tea.", "Leonard: What\u2019s that?", "Sheldon: Tea. When people are upset the cultural convention is to bring them hot beverages. There there. You want to talk about it?", "Leonard: No.", "Sheldon: Good. There there was really all I had. ", "Leonard: Good night Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Good night Leonard. ", "Penny (knocking on door and entering): Hey Leonard.", "Leonard: Hi Penny.", "Penny: Hey, I just wanted to make sure you\u2019re okay.", "Leonard: I\u2019m fine. ", "Penny: I\u2019m so sorry about what happened.", "Leonard: It\u2019s not your fault.", "Penny: Yes it is. That\u2019s why I broke up with him, he always does stuff like that. ", "Leonard: So why was he at your party?", "Penny: Well, I ran into him last week and, he was\u2026 \u00a0just, all apologetic, about how he\u2019s changed, he was just going on and on and I believed him, and I\u2019m an idiot because I always believe guys like that and\u2026 I can\u2019t go back to my party because he\u2019s there, and I know you don\u2019t want to hear this and I\u2019m upset and I\u2019m really drunk and I just want to\u2026 (bursts into tears and rests head on Leonard\u2019s shoulder.)", "Leonard: There there. ", "Penny: God, what is wrong with me.", "Leonard: Nothing, you\u2019re perfect.", "Penny: Gah, I\u2019m not perfect.", "Leonard: Yes you are. ", "Penny: You really think so, don\u2019t you? (She kisses hm.)", "Leonard: Penny?", "Penny: Yeah. ", "Leonard: How much have you had to drink tonight?", "Penny: Just\u2026. a lot. ", "Leonard: Are you sure that your being drunk, and your being angry with Kurt doesn\u2019t have something to do with what\u2019s going on here?", "Penny: It might. Boy, you\u2019re really smart.", "Leonard: Yeah, I\u2019m a frickin\u2019 genius. ", "Penny: Leonard, you are so great. Why can\u2019t all guys be like you? ", "Leonard: Because if all guys were like me, the human race couldn\u2019t survive. ", "Penny: I should probably go.", "Leonard: Probably. ", "Penny (in doorway): Thank you. (She kisses him again. Kurt is watching.)", "Leonard: That\u2019s right, you saw what you saw. That\u2019s how we roll in The Shire. (Closes door quickly, locks and chains it.)", "Scene: The apartment, there is a knock on the door. ", "Sheldon: Coming. (Opens door to Howard.)", "Howard: Hey, have you seen Koothrapali?", "Sheldon: He\u2019s not here. Maybe the Avenger summoned him. ", "Howard: He\u2019s not the Marvel comic story, he\u2019s the original Norse God. ", "Sheldon: Thank you for the clarification. ", "Howard: I\u2019m supposed to give him a ride home.", "Sheldon: Well I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine. He has his hammer. ", "Scene: A random bedroom. Butterfly costume girl is climbing off of Raj. ", "Butterfly Girl: Wow, I have to say, you are an amazing man. You\u2019re gentle and passionate, and my God, you are such a good listener! ", "(Raj puts hands behind head with a smug expression on his face.)"]}
