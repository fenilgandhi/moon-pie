It is Leonard\u2019s move. He takes his time, moving round the board and checking things from various angles. Finally he tentatively makes a move. Sheldon moves almost immediately.", "Sheldon: Checkmate.", "Leonard: O-o-o-o-h! Again?", "Sheldon: Obviously you\u2019re not well suited for three-dimensional chess, perhaps three dimensional candyland would be more your speed. ", "Leonard: Just reset the board.", "Sheldon: It must be humbling to suck on so many different levels. ", "Penny (knocking and entering): Hi guys.", "Leonard: Hey! ", "Penny: Did you get my mail.", "Leonard: Yeah, right here. How was Nebraska?", "Penny: Oh, better than North Dakota! (Pause) I guess that joke\u2019s only funny in Nebraska.", "Sheldon: From the data at hand you really can\u2019t draw that conclusion. All you can say with absolute certainty is that that joke is not funny here. ", "Penny: Boy, it\u2019s good to be back. ", "Leonard: How was your family?", "Penny: Ugh, it was the worst trip, everyone got sick over the weekend.", "Sheldon: Sick? ", "Leonard: Here we go. ", "Sheldon (running to opposite side of the room): What kind of sick?", "Penny: Oh, the flu I guess.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t need you to guess, I need you to know, now when did the symptoms first appear?", "Penny: Maybe Friday.", "Sheldon: Friday, was that morning or afternoon? ", "Penny: I\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026", "Sheldon: Think woman, who blew their nose and when? ", "Leonard: Sheldon, relax, she doesn\u2019t have any symptoms, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not contagious.", "Sheldon: Oh please, if influenza was only contagious after symptoms appear it would have died out thousands of years ago. Somewhere between tool using and cave painting, homo habilus would have figured out to kill the guy with the runny nose. ", "Leonard: Penny, you\u2019ll have to excuse Sheldon, he\u2019s a bit of a germophobe. ", "Penny: Oh, it\u2019s okay, I understand.", "Sheldon: Thanks for your consideration, now please leave.", "Leonard: You\u2019d better go before he starts spraying you with Lysol. ", "Penny: Okay, well, thank you for getting my mail.", "Leonard: No problem. Welcome home. (Sees Penny out. Turns to find Sheldon spraying the air with Lysol.)", "Sheldon: What?", "Credits sequence", "Scene: The kitchen", "Leonard: What the hell are you doing?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m making petrie dishes to grow throat cultures.

If I\u2019m going to get ahead of this thing I need to find out what\u2019s growing in my throat. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, you are not sick. This is, but you are not.

", "Sheldon: I need to measure my fluid intake and output to make sure my kidneys aren\u2019t shutting down.", "Leonard: I mix pancake batter in this! ", "Sheldon: No, that measuring cup has always been for urine.", "Leonard: You had time to make a label for everything in this apartment, including the label maker, but you didn\u2019t have ten seconds to make one that said urine cup? ", "Sheldon: It\u2019s right here on the bottom. ", "Leonard: Huh. I guess I owe the Betty Crocker company a letter of apology. ", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom. Sheldon wakes up and coughs. Picks up an electronic thermometer and takes his temperature.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear God. (Shouting) Leonard! Leonard, I\u2019m sick!", "Cut to Leonard entering living room in panic, stumbling and trying to put on a pair of trousers.", "Sheldon (voice off): Leonard! Leonard I\u2019m sick!", "Leonard grabs jacket and leaves through front door.", "Sheldon (entering, wrapped in duvet): Leonard! Leonard! Leonard. Leonard, my comforter fell down, and my sinuses hurt when I bend over. Leonard? (Bends to get phone) Ow! ", "Leonard (voice on phone): Hey.", "Sheldon: Leonard, where are you?

", "Leonard: They asked me to come in.", "Sheldon: Well, I didn\u2019t hear the phone ring.", "Leonard: They texted me. ", "Sheldon: Well, as I predicted, I am sick. My fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2am, and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate. ", "Leonard: No kidding?", "Sheldon: No. Not only that, it has shifted from clear to milky green. ", "Leonard: Alright, well, get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. ", "Sheldon: What else would I drink? Gasses? Solids? Ionised plasma?", "Leonard: Drink whatever you want.", "Sheldon: I want soup.", "Leonard: Then make soup. ", "Sheldon: We don\u2019t have soup. ", "Leonard: I\u2019m at work, Sheldon. (A woman enters the apartment building with a barking dog.) ", "Sheldon: Is that a dog?", "Leonard: Yes, ", "Sheldon: In the lab?", "Leonard: Yes, they\u2019re training dogs to operate the centrifuge for when they need dogs to operate the centrifuge for blind scientists, I have to go.

(To Leonard) It was Sheldon.", "Leonard: I tried to stop you. ", "Howard: It\u2019s my own fault, I forgot the protocol we put in place after the great ear infection of \u201906. ", "Leonard: You call Koothrappali, we need to find a place to lay low for the next eighteen to twenty four hours. ", "Howard: Stand by. Ma, can my friends come over?", "Howard\u2019s Mother: I just had the carpets steamed. ", "Howard: That\u2019s a negatory. But there\u2019s a Planet of the Apes marathon at the New Art today.

Sheldon, what are you doing here?", "Sheldon: I\u2019m sick, thank you very much. ", "Penny: How could you have gotten it from me, I\u2019m not sick.", "Sheldon: You\u2019re a carrier. All these people here are doomed. You\u2019re doomed! ", "Penny: Shhh! Sheldon, what do you want.", "Sheldon: I want soup.", "Penny (over Sheldon\u2019s strange throat clearance): Why didn\u2019t you just\u2026. (louder throat clearance) Why didn\u2019t you just have soup at home. ", "Sheldon: Penny, I have an IQ of 187, don\u2019t you imagine that if there were a way for me to have had soup at home I would have thought of it?", "Penny: You can have soup delivered.", "Sheldon: I did not think of that. Clearly febrile delirium is setting in, please bring me some soup while I still understand what a spoon is for.

", "Penny: Sheldon, you are a grown man, haven\u2019t you ever been sick before? ", "Sheldon: Well, of course, but, not by myself. ", "Penny: Really, never?", "Sheldon: Well, once. When I was fifteen, and spending the summer at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.", "Penny: Studying abroad?", "Sheldon: No, visiting professor. Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more sausage-based than I\u2019m used to, and the result was an internal blitzkrieg with my lower intestine playing the part of Czechoslovakia. ", "Penny: And there was no-one there to take care of you?", "Sheldon: No. No, my mum had to fly back to Texas to help my dad because the house had slipped off the cinderblocks again. ", "Penny: Again?", "Sheldon: It was tornado season. And it was an aluminium house. Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty residence didn\u2019t speak any English, when I finally managed to convince her I was sick, she said \u201cM\u00f6chtest Du eine Darmsp\u00fclung?\u201d", "Penny: What does that mean?", "Sheldon: Based on what happened next, I assume it means \u201cwould you like an enema?\u201d", "Penny: Okay, sweetie, I\u2019ll take care of you, what do you need?", "Sheldon: Well, my mom used to give me sponge baths.

I was wondering, is Sheldon still at the restaurant? Okay, that was very nice of you. Okay, gotta go, got kind of a full blown Chernobyl thing here, gotta go, bye. (To Howard) He\u2019s home, I\u2019m screwed. Ten and a half hours of apey blurriness. ", "Raj: How about Lasic? ", "Leonard: You want me to get eye surgery? ", "Raj: Would you rather go back to the apartment and deal with Sheldon, or have a stranger carve out your corneas with a laser beam?", "Howard: Well?", "Leonard: I\u2019m thinking! ", "Scene: Sheldon\u2019s bedroom.", "Penny: Okay, nice and cosy, okay, I\u2019ll see you later.", "Sheldon: Wait. Will you please rub this on my chest.

", "Scene: The living room door, a fibre-optic camera emerges from underneath. We see the scene from its point of view. Cut to outside. Raj is holding a laptop, Howard is feeding the camera under the door. ", "Leonard: What do you see, what do you see.", "Raj: The living room appears to be empty. ", "Leonard: Okay, he must be in his bedroom. My spare glasses are in my bedroom, on my dresser, next to my Bat-signal. ", "Howard: I\u2019m not going in there.", "Leonard: Raj?", "Raj: No way, Jose. ", "Leonard: Well I can\u2019t do it, I can\u2019t see anything. ", "Howard: It\u2019s all right, wireless mini-cam and Bluetooth headset. We\u2019ll be your eyes. ", "Leonard: Fine.", "Howard: One more thing. This is a subsonic impact sensor. If Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk, this device will register it and send a signal to the laptop. At that point, based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a sick Sheldon, you\u2019ll have seven seconds to get out, glasses or no glasses.", "Leonard: Won\u2019t my footsteps set it off?

Now keep true.", "Leonard: What? ", "Howard: It means go straight.", "Leonard: Then just say go straight. ", "Howard: You don\u2019t stay go straight when you\u2019re giving bearings, you say keep true. ", "Leonard: Alright (Bangs head on a trunk.) I just hit my head. ", "Howard: Because you didn\u2019t keep true. (Time shift, Leonard is now outside bedrooms) Okay, turn right. ", "Raj: The\u2026 the picture\u2019s breaking up. ", "Howard: Angle your head to the right. A little more. A little more. (Leonard now has his head at right angles to his body) That\u2019s it, now just keep true. Alright, you\u2019re close enough to Sheldon\u2019s room, deploy the sensor. Now turn it on.", "Leonard: It wasn\u2019t on? ", "Howard: No.", "Leonard: Then why did I have to crawl? ", "Howard: Oh, I guess you didn\u2019t. ", "Leonard: Okay, it\u2019s on.", "Howard: Good. From this point forward you will have to crawl. ", "Leonard: I know.
