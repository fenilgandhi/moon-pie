{"series": "1", "episode": "16", "transcript": ["Scene: The Cheesecake Factory. Raj and Sheldon are arm wrestling while playing tetris. There is a cacophony of cries such as \u201ctake him down\u201d and \u201che\u2019s got you, Sheldon.\u201d", "Penny: Hey, guys, guys, some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something.", "Leonard: Oh, it\u2019s called trestling.", "Howard: It combines the physical strength of arm wrestling with the mental agility of tetris into the ultimate sport. ", "Penny: Yeah, that\u2019s terrific, but what they wanted me to ask you was to cut it the hell out. (To someone off) Right come on guys, come on. (Singing while approaching another table) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you\u2026", "Sheldon: We might as well stop, it\u2019s a stalemate. You\u2019re beating me in tetris, but you\u2019ve got the upper body strength of a Keebler Elf.", "Raj: Keebler Elf? I\u2019ve got your Keebler Elf right here. (Strains to push Sheldon\u2019s arm down. Tries using both hands, still with no effect.) Okay, it\u2019s a stalemate. ", "Penny: So Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday for your free birthday cheesecake?", "Sheldon: He can\u2019t eat cheesecake, he\u2019s lactose intolerant. ", "Penny: Okay, he can have carrot cake.", "Sheldon: What about the cream cheese frosting.", "Penny: he can scrape it off. ", "Leonard: Forget about the cake, how did you know that my birthday is Saturday? ", "Penny: I did your horoscope, remember, I was going to do everybody\u2019s until Sheldon went on one of his typical psychotic rants.", "Sheldon: For the record, that psychotic rant was a concise summation of the research of Bertram Forer, who in 1948 proved conclusively through meticulously designed experiments, that astrology is nothing but pseudo scientific hokum. ", "Penny: Blah blah blah, a typical Taurus. So, seriously, are we going to see you Saturday?", "Leonard: Oh, I don\u2019t think so.", "Penny: Why not?", "Leonard: I don\u2019t celebrate my birthday.", "Penny: Shuddup, yeah you do. ", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s no big deal, it\u2019s just the way I was raised. My parents focussed on celebrating achievements, and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them.", "Penny: Uh, that\u2019s so silly.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s actually based on very sound theories, his mother published a paper on it. ", "Penny: What was it called, \u201cI hate my son and that\u2019s why he can\u2019t have cake?\u201d ", "Sheldon: It was obviously effective, Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist. Perhaps if she\u2019d also denied him Christmas he\u2019d be a little better at it. ", "Leonard: Thank you.", "Howard: Well I love birthdays, waking up to Mom\u2019s special French Toast breakfast, wearing the birthday king crown, playing laser tag with all my friends.", "Penny: Yeah, see, that\u2019s what kids should have. ", "Howard: Actually that was last year. ", "Penny: So you\u2019ve really never had a birthday party? ", "Leonard: No. But it was okay. I mean, when I was little I\u2019d think maybe my parents would change their mind, and surprise me with a party, like this one birthday I came home from my Cello lesson, and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front, and when I got to the door I could hear people whispering, and I could smell German chocolate cake, which is my favourite.", "Penny: And?", "Leonard: Uh, it turns out my grandfather had died. \u00a0", "Penny: Oh my God, that\u2019s terrible. ", "Leonard: Oh, it was kind of like a birthday party. I got to see all my cousins and there was cake, so\u20267", "Penny: That\u2019s the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. ", "Howard: You think? Go ahead, tell her about your senior prom. ", "Credits sequence.", "Scene: Leonard is exiting the apartment. ", "Howard (voice from inside): Make sure they remember no peanuts.", "Leonard: Howard, every Thai restaurant in town knows you can\u2019t eat peanuts. They see me coming they go \u201cah, no peanut boy!\u201d", "(Leonard exits down stairs. A moment later, Penny peeks out of her apartment, checks the coast is clear, and crosses the hall to the guys apartment. Knocks.)", "Sheldon (answering): Hello Penny. Leonard just left.", "Penny: I know. I want to talk to you. ", "Sheldon: What would we talk about? We\u2019ve no overlapping areas of interest I\u2019m aware of, and you know I don\u2019t care for chit-chat. ", "Penny: Okay, can you just let me in.", "Sheldon: Well alright, but I don\u2019t see this as a promising endeavour.", "Penny: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, we are going to throw Leonard a kick-ass surprise party for his birthday on Saturday.", "Sheldon: I hardly think so, Leonard made it very clear he doesn\u2019t want a party.", "Howard: Did someone say party? ", "Penny: He just doesn\u2019t know he wants one because he\u2019s never had one. ", "Howard: I suppose that\u2019s possible, but for the record, I\u2019ve never had a threesome and yet I still know I want one.", "Penny: Howard, here\u2019s the difference. The possibility exists that Leonard could have a birthday party before hell freezes over. ", "Howard: Fine. If I do have a threesome, you can\u2019t be part of it. I\u2019m just kidding, yes you can. Can you bring a friend? ", "Sheldon: I think a birthday party is a terrible idea. I envy Leonard for growing up without that anguish. ", "Penny: Anguish?", "Sheldon: Year after year, I had to endure wearing conical hats while being forced into the crowded sweaty hell of bouncy castles, not to mention being blindfolded and spun towards a grotesque tailless donkey as the other children mocked my disorientation. ", "Penny: Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars that no non-professional can heal, but nevertheless we are going to throw Leonard a birthday party. ", "Sheldon: Have I pointed out that I am extremely uncomfortable with dancing, loud music and most other forms of alcohol induced frivolity. ", "Penny: Nevertheless we are\u2026.", "Sheldon: In addition I really don\u2019t think that Leonard wants a\u2026", "Penny: Okay, here\u2019s the deal, you either help me throw Leonard a birthday party or, so help me God, I will go into your bedroom and I will unbag all of your most valuable mint condition comic books. And on one of them, you won\u2019t know which, I\u2019ll draw a tiny happy face in ink. ", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t do that, if you make a mark on a mint comic book it\u2019s no longer mint.", "Penny: Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?", "Sheldon: Well of course I\u2026 oh! Yeah, I have an idea, let\u2019s throw Leonard a kick ass birthday party.", "Scene: Howard and Raj sneak up the stairwell carrying presents. Howard knocks on Penny\u2019s door, a combination of two knocks, two knocks, one knock. Nothing happens. He tries again. Sheldon opens the door. ", "Sheldon: That\u2019s not the secret knock. This is the secret knock. (He knocks two, one, two.)", "Howard: What difference does it make?", "Sheldon: The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a non-verbal signal to verify the identity of one\u2019s co-conspirators. ", "Penny: Is that Raj and Howard?", "Sheldon: Possibly, but unverified.", "Howard: Can you just let us in.", "Sheldon: Luckily for you this is not a nuclear reactor. ", "Penny: So, what did you get the birthday boy?", "Howard: Well, Raj got him an awesome limited edition Dark Knight sculpture based on Alex Ross\u2019s definitive Batman, and I got him this amazing autographed copy of the Feynman lectures on physics.", "Penny: Nice. I got him a sweater. ", "Howard: Okay, well, he might like that, I\u2019ve seen him\u2026 chilly. ", "Penny: Uh, Sheldon, I didn\u2019t see your present.", "Sheldon: That\u2019s because I didn\u2019t bring one.", "Penny: Well why not? ", "Howard: Don\u2019t ask.", "Sheldon: The entire institution of gift giving makes no sense.", "Howard: Too late.", "Sheldon: Let\u2019s say that I go out and I spend fifty dollars on you, it\u2019s a laborious activity, because I have to imagine what you need, whereas you know what you need. Now I can simplify things, just give you the fifty dollars directly and, you could give me fifty dollars on my birthday, and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and fifty dollars richer. And I ask you, is it worth it? ", "Howard: Told you not to ask. ", "Penny: Well, Sheldon, you\u2019re his friend. Friends give each other presents.", "Sheldon: I accept your premise, I reject your conclusion.", "Howard: Try telling him it\u2019s a non-optional social convention. ", "Penny: What?", "Howard: Just do it. ", "Penny: It\u2019s a non-optional social convention.", "Sheldon: Oh. Fair enough. ", "Howard: He came with a manual. ", "Sheldon: Question, how am I going to get Leonard a present before the party? I don\u2019t drive, and the only things available within walking distance are a Thai restaurant and a gas station. I suppose I could wrap up an order of mee krob and a couple of lottery scratchers. ", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s do this, um, I will drive Sheldon to get a present, and Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard for about two hours. ", "Howard: No problem.", "Penny: And then Raj, you bring the stuff across the hall and start setting up.", "Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): What if guests show up?", "Penny: Entertain them.", "Howard: What if they\u2019re women?", "Penny: Stare at them and make them feel uncomfortable. ", "Scene: The apartment. Leonard is playing an X-Box game. ", "Howard (entering): Hey!", "Leonard: Hey. ", "Howard: How\u2019s it going?", "Leonard: Fine. ", "Howard: So, listen, the New Art is showing the revised definitive cut of Blade Runner.", "Leonard: Seen it.", "Howard: No, you\u2019ve seen the 25th anniversary final cut. This one has eight seconds of previously unseen footage. They say it completely changes the tone of the film. ", "Leonard: Oh. Pass. ", "Howard: Come on, afterwards there\u2019s a Q & A with Harrison Ford\u2019s body double. ", "Leonard: Look, I am in the Halo battle of my life here, there\u2019s this kid in Copenhagen, he has no immune system so all he does is sit in his bubble and play Halo 24/7.", "Howard: Can\u2019t you play him some other time?", "Leonard: Not if you believe his doctors. ", "Howard: Oh my God, do you smell gas.", "Leonard: No.", "Howard: Yeah, no. ", "Scene: An electrical store.", "Penny: Alright, you know they have DVDs over there.", "Sheldon: Yes, but they have DVD burners over here. Leonard needs a DVD burner. ", "Penny: Sheldon, a gift shouldn\u2019t be something someone needs, it should be something fun, you know, something they wouldn\u2019t buy for themselves.", "Sheldon: You mean, like a sweater? ", "Penny: Well, it\u2019s a fun sweater, it\u2019s got a bold geometric print. ", "Sheldon: Is it the geometry that makes it fun.", "Penny: Okay, the point is, one of the ways we show we care about people is by putting thought and imagination into the gifts we give them. ", "Sheldon: Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.", "Penny: Exactly.", "Sheldon: Something he wouldn\u2019t buy for himself. Something fun. Something like\u2026 oh, an 802.11n wireless router. ", "Scene: The apartment.", "Leonard: Here you go, Copenhagen boy, how about a taste of Hans Christian Hand Grenade. (Raj enters carrying party supplies. Howard waves him away while in the background Leonard is heard saying \u201coh, that did not feel good.\u201d) Come on, come on, oh you clever little\u2026. Come on, come on, take that! ", "Howard (picks up a granola bar from the table, breaks off half and puts it in his back pocket.): Oh-oh. (Louder) Oh-oh! ", "Leonard: What\u2019s the matter?", "Howard: This granola bar, there\u2019s peanuts in it.", "Leonard: Oh my God, why did you eat it?", "Howard: I don\u2019t know, it was just there.", "Leonard: Well if I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? ", "Howard: Don\u2019t yell at me, I\u2019ve got to go to the emergency room. ", "Leonard: Now?", "Howard: No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket. ", "Leonard: Alright, um, just, uh, let me get my keys.", "Howard: Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh\u2026. (into phone after Leonard leaves room) The laundry is out of the hamper. (Looks exasperated) Okay Sheldon, what was it supposed to be? Fine, it\u2019s out of the washer. I\u2019ll call you when it\u2019s in the dryer. ", "Leonard (running in): Alright, let\u2019s go. (They exit, with Howard making croaking noises.) ", "Scene: The store. Sheldon is looking at two routers.", "Sheldon: What do you think.", "Penny (pointing randomly): Um, that one. ", "Sheldon: Because of the two additional Ethernet ports.", "Penny: Sure.", "Sheldon: He doesn\u2019t need them, he\u2019s already got a 640 connect switch ", "Penny: Oh, okay then this one. ", "Sheldon: Why? ", "Penny: I don\u2019t know, the man on the box looks so happy. ", "Sheldon: Penny! If I\u2019m going to buy Leonard a gift, I\u2019m going to do it right. I refuse to let him experience the same childhood trauma I did. ", "Penny: Oh, I know I\u2019m going to regret this but, what trauma? ", "Sheldon: On my twelfth birthday I really wanted a titanium centrifuge, so, you know, I could separate radioactive isotopes. ", "Penny: Of course.", "Sheldon: Instead of a titanium centrifuge, my parents bought me\u2026 wow, this is hard. They got me\u2026 a motorised dirt bike. ", "Penny: No? ", "Sheldon: What twelve year old boy wants a motorised dirt bike? ", "Penny: All of them.", "Sheldon: Really?", "Penny: Yeah.", "Sheldon: Huh? ", "Penny: Okay, so we\u2019re getting this one?", "Sheldon: Yeah, I suppose. ", "Penny: Okay, let\u2019s go.", "Random woman: Excuse me, do you know anything about this stuff? ", "Sheldon: I know everything about this stuff.", "Woman: Okay, I have my own wholesale flower business, and I want to hook up my computer in the front entrance with the one in my refrigerated warehouse. ", "Penny: Here, buy this one. Look, it\u2019s the one we\u2019re getting, see, happy guy available. ", "Sheldon: No, no, no, no, she doesn\u2019t want that, she needs a point to point peer network with a range extender.", "Woman: Thank you. ", "Random guy: Which hard drive do I want, firewire or USB?", "Sheldon: It depends on what Bus you have.", "Guy: I drive a Chevy Cavalier.", "Sheldon: Oh, dear lord.", "Penny: Sheldon, we have to go.", "Sheldon: Not now, Penny, this poor man needs me. (To woman approaching) You hold on, I\u2019ll be right with you. What computer do you have, and please don\u2019t say a white one?", "Scene: The hospital. Howard runs in and up to the counter.", "Howard: Excuse me.", "Nurse: Fill this out, have a seat. ", "Howard: No, listen, see we\u2019re throwing my friend a surprise party and I\u2019m supposed to keep him out of his apartment for two hours.", "Nurse: Uh-huh, fill this out and have a seat. ", "Howard: No, see, the only way I could get him to leave is to tell him I ate a peanut. Because I\u2019m allergic to peanuts. ", "Nurse: Oh, well in that case fill this out and have a seat. ", "Howard: Look, all I need from you is to take me in the back and give me a band-aid so I can pretend I had a shot of epinephrine and they you tell my friend you need to keep me under observation for about an hour, hour and a half. ", "Nurse: Is that all you need?", "Howard: Yes.", "Nurse: Get out of my ER. ", "Howard: No, you don\u2019t understand.", "Nurse: Oh, I understand, but unfortunately this hospital is not equipped to treat stupid. ", "Howard: Okay, I get it, I know how the world works, how about if I were to introduce you (holding up a five dollar bill) to the man who freed your people. ", "Nurse, unless my people were freed by Benjamin Franklin and his five twin brothers you are wasting your time. ", "Leonard (running in): Hey, sorry I couldn\u2019t find a parking spot, how are you doing.", "Howard: Bad, very bad. ", "Leonard: Really, \u2018cos you don\u2019t look like you\u2019re swelling up at all, maybe we should just pick up some benedryl at the drug store and go home. ", "Howard: We can\u2019t go home. ", "Leonard: Why not?", "Howard: Becauth (pretends tongue has swollen up) Becauth-th-th. Brissket, Brissket! Water, need water. ", "Leonard: Alright, I\u2019ll be right back. ", "Howard (into phone): Penny, look, I\u2019ve got a problem.", "Penny (with Sheldon in background at the head of a large queue of customers): Yeah, well so do I, look you\u2019ve got to stall Leonard a little longer.", "Howard: I don\u2019t think I can. ", "Penny: You have to, we all have to be there at the same time to yell \u201csurprise!\u201d ", "Howard: Okay, you have to understand something, we\u2019re in a hospital right now. ", "Penny: Why, is Leonard okay.", "Howard: Leonard\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine, thanks for asking, by the way. ", "Penny: Okay, I don\u2019t need your attitude, just hold him there a little longer. ", "Howard: Look, I\u2019ve done my best but he wants to go home and I don\u2019t know how to stop him. ", "Penny: Okay, how about this. You keep him there a little longer and when you get to the party I\u2019ll point out which of my friends are easy. ", "Howard: Don\u2019t toy with me, woman. ", "Penny: I\u2019ve got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem, I\u2019ve got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who\u2019s two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat.

And for another, I told him to call security. ", "Sheldon (to customer): Good luck. (To assistant) By the way, a six year-old could hack your computer system.
