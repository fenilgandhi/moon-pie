I asked for turkey and roast beef with lettuce and swiss on wholewheat.", "Raj: What did they give you?", "Sheldon: Turkey and roast beef with swiss and lettuce on wholewheat. It\u2019s the right ingredients but in the wrong order. In a proper sandwich the cheese is adjacent to the bread to create a moisture barrier against the lettuce. They might as well have dragged this thing through a car wash. ", "Leonard: I don\u2019t believe it.", "Sheldon: I know, it\u2019s basic culinary science.

", "Leonard: No, a time machine from Sophie\u2019s Choice. ", "Raj: Boy, Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie. Did you see it, it\u2019s rough. ", "Howard: Oh, that\u2019s cool.", "Leonard: Uh-huh.", "Raj: It\u2019s only $800?", "Leonard: Yeah. And that\u2019s my bid.", "Sheldon: You bid $800.", "Leonard: It was a spur of the moment thing, I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it. ", "Sheldon: There\u2019s only 30 seconds left in the auction.", "Howard: Do you have $800?", "Leonard: Not to blow on a miniature time machine. ", "Howard: Don\u2019t worry, the way these things work there\u2019s people waiting \u2018til the last second to bid, and then they swoop in and get it, it\u2019s called sniping.", "Raj: Fifteen seconds.", "Leonard: Come on, snipers. ", "Raj: Ten, nine, eight\u2026", "Leonard: Where are your snipers?", "Raj: Five.", "Leonard: Snipe.", "Raj: Four.", "Leonard: Snipe. ", "Raj: Three.", "Leonard: Snipe!", "Raj: Two.", "Leonard: SNIPE!", "Raj: One.", "Leonard: Aaaa-aw! ", "Raj: Congratulations, you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine.", "Howard: You lucky duck. ", "Sheldon: I wonder why no-one else bid, this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia. ", "Leonard: Yeah, I know, I still can\u2019t afford it. ", "Howard: Why don\u2019t we share it? We\u2019ll each put in two hundred bucks and we\u2019ll take turns having it in our homes.", "Raj: A time share time machine? I\u2019m in. Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Need you ask? But I still don\u2019t understand why no-one else bid. ", "Scene: The lobby. The guys stand around a full sized time machine. ", "Sheldon: I understand why no-one else bid. ", "Credits sequence", "Scene: The same", "Raj: Did the listing actually say miniature?", "Leonard: I just assumed. Who sells a full sized time machine for $800?", "Sheldon: In a venn diagram, that would be an individual located within the intersection of the sets \u201cno longer want my time machine\u201d and \u201cneed $800\u201d.", "Howard: It\u2019s actually a tremendous bargain, even with shipping it works out to less than four dollars a pound. ", "Raj: Cocktain shrimp are $12.50.", "Leonard: How are we going to get it upstairs? ", "Howard: If we take the dish off it might fit in the elevator. ", "Leonard: Yes but the elevator\u2019s been broken for two years. ", "Sheldon: I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you, do you think we should make a call about that? ", "Howard: Not necessary, I have a masters in engineering, I remotely repair satellites on a regular basis. I troubleshoot space shuttle payloads. When the Mars rover started pulling to the left I performed a front end alignment from 62 million miles away. (Presses lift button. Nothing happens.) No, that baby\u2019s broken. ", "Scene: The stairwell, approaching the apartment door. Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the last part of the stairs.", "Leonard: Come on, guys, push. ", "Howard (off): If I push any harder I\u2019m going to give birth to my colon. ", "Raj (off): I can\u2019t feel my fingers, hurry up. ", "Sheldon: It\u2019s the same amount of work no matter how fast you go, basic physics.", "Raj: Sheldon?", "Sheldon: Yeah. ", "Raj: If my fingers ever work again, I\u2019ve got a job for the middle one. ", "Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.", "Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! ", "Penny: What are you doing?", "Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving\u2026 something upstairs. ", "Penny: What is it?", "Leonard: It\u2019s\u2026 you know, time machine. ", "Penny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so\u2026.", "Leonard: Uh, just give us a few minutes.", "Penny: I don\u2019t have a few minutes, I\u2019m running really late.", "Sheldon: Then I have a simple solution, go up to the roof, hop over to the next building, there\u2019s a small gap, don\u2019t look down if you\u2019re subject to vertigo, and use their stairwell. ", "Penny: You\u2019re joking, right?", "Sheldon: Oh, I never joke when it comes to vertigo. ", "Penny: Damn, okay, I\u2019ll just take the roof. ", "Leonard: Hey, if you wait for us to set up the time machine, I can drop you off at work yesterday. Time travel joke, it\u2019s not\u2026 never mind. ", "Sheldon: For what it\u2019s worth, I thought it was humorous. ", "Leonard: Let\u2019s just do this. Guys, ready to push?", "Raj: In a minute. Howard stepped outside to throw up. ", "Scene: The living room. The time machine is set up.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t know what you were worried about. I think it really works in the room.", "Leonard: Yeah. It is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned. ", "Sheldon: The exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future, which society had splintered into two factions, the sub-terranean Morlocks, who survived by feasting on the flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy. ", "Howard: Talk about your chick magnets. ", "Raj: Oh yeah. The guy who lives next to me is always like, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony, I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony. But wait until I tell him, I\u2019ve got a time machine on my balcony. Stuff that in your speedos, Jacuzzi Bob!", "Sheldon: Gentlemen, I know we said we\u2019d take turns, but I think you\u2019d agree that practicality dictates it remain here. ", "Howard: You can\u2019t just keep it here, what if I meet a girl and say, \u201cyou wanna come up and see my time machine, it\u2019s at my friends house,\u201d how lame is that? ", "Raj: He\u2019s got a point.", "Sheldon: Alright, I think we\u2019re going to need some ground rules, in addition to the expected no shoes in the time machine and no eating in the time machine, I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine. ", "Leonard: Seconded. ", "Howard: I was going to put down a towel. ", "Raj: I still want it on my balcony. I say we move it on a bi-monthly basis. ", "Leonard: That sounds fair.", "Sheldon: Hold on. Bi-monthly is an ambiguous term, do you mean move it every other month, or twice a month? ", "Raj: Twice a month.", "Sheldon: Then no. ", "Raj: Okay, every other month.", "Sheldon: No. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, you can\u2019t be selfish, we all paid for it, so it belongs to all of us. Now out of the way so I can sit in my time machine. (Sits and turns it on. The three lights on the front illuminate. All let out an \u201coh\u201d.) Okay, I am setting the dials for March 10th, 1876. ", "Howard: Good choice, Alexander Graham Bell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson.", "Sheldon: Wait a minute, I\u2019d want to see that too. ", "Leonard: So, when it\u2019s your turn you can.", "Sheldon: But if we all go back to the same point in time, Bell\u2019s lab is going to get very crowded, he\u2019ll know something\u2019s up. ", "Raj: Also, since the time machine doesn\u2019t move in space, you\u2019ll end up in 1876 Pasadena. ", "Howard: And even if you can make it to Boston, what are you going to do, knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell, \u201chey Mrs Bell, big fan of your husband, can I come in and watch him invent the telephone?\u201d", "Raj: Mrs Bell was deaf, she\u2019s not even going to hear you knock. ", "Sheldon: Oh, I have a solution, first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device.", "Raj: Ooh, how far into the future?", "Sheldon: If I remember correctly, Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the Romulans on Stardate 5027.3, which will be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation reckoning.", "Leonard: Okay, I am setting the dials for January 10th, 2328. Here we go into the future. (Pulls lever, the disk begins to spin. The other guys all run around the flat as if moving in fast motion.) That was fun. ", "Raj: My turn.", "Penny (entering): Okay, first of all, what you call a gap was nearly three feet wide, I slipped and skinned my knee.", "Leonard: Are you okay?", "Penny: Zzz-zz-zz-zz! Second of all, the door to the stairwell of the other building was locked, so I had to go down the fire escape which ends on the third floor, forcing me to crawl through the window of a lovely Armenian family, who insisted I stay for lunch. ", "Leonard: That doesn\u2019t sound too bad.", "Penny: It was eight courses of lamb, and they tried to fix me up with their son.", "Leonard: Sorry.", "Penny: Not done. By the time I finally got to work, they\u2019d given my shift away. Yeah, that\u2019s right, I\u2019ve lost an entire day\u2019s pay thanks to this\u2026 this\u2026", "Sheldon: Time machine. ", "Leonard: The lights flash and the dish spins, you wanna try it?", "Penny: No! I don\u2019t want to try it, my God, you are grown men, how could you waste your lives with these stupid toys and costumes and comic books and\u2026 and now that\u2026 that\u2026", "Sheldon: Again, time machine. ", "Penny: Oh please, it\u2019s not a time machine, if anything it looks like something Elton John would drive through the Everglades.", "Sheldon: It only moves in time. It would be worse than useless in a swamp. ", "Penny: Pathetic. All of you, completely pathetic. (Storms out. A beat, and then\u2026) ", "Raj: My turn! ", "Scene: Later that night, Leonard is sitting in the time machine, turning the lights on and off. Sheldon enters.", "Sheldon: Leonard, it\u2019s two in the morning. ", "Leonard: So?", "Sheldon: So it\u2019s my turn. Why did you set it for the day before yesterday?", "Leonard: Because I want to go back and keep myself from getting a time machine.", "Sheldon: You can\u2019t. If you were to prevent yourself from buying it in the past, you would not have it available in the present to travel back and stop yourself from buying it, ergo you would still have it. This is a classic rookie time travel mistake. ", "Leonard: Can I go back and prevent you from explaining that to me?", "Sheldon: Same paradox. If you were to travel back in time and, say, knock me unconscious, you would not then have the conversation that irritated you, motivating you to go back and knock me unconscious. ", "Leonard: What if I knocked you unconscious right now? ", "Sheldon: It won\u2019t change the past. ", "Leonard: But it would make the present so much nicer. ", "Sheldon: Are you upset about something? ", "Leonard: What was your first clue?", "Sheldon: Well, it was a number of things. First the late hour, then your demeanour seems very low energy, plus your irritability\u2026", "Leonard: Yes I\u2019m upset. ", "Sheldon: Oh! I don\u2019t usually pick up on those things. Good for me. ", "Leonard: Yeah, good for you. ", "Sheldon: Oh, wait. Did you want to talk about what\u2019s bothering you? ", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know. Maybe.", "Sheldon: Wow, I\u2019m on fire tonight. ", "Leonard: Uh, here\u2019s the thing. Girls like Penny never end up with guys who own time machines. ", "Sheldon: I disagree. Your inability to successfully woo Penny long predates your acquisition of the time machine. That failure clearly stands on its own.", "Leonard: Thanks for pointing it out.", "Sheldon: In addition, your premise is flawed. In the original film, Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimeaux with that very time machine. In Back to the Future, Marty McFly got the opportunity to hook up with his extremely attractive young mother. ", "Leonard: Those are movies.", "Sheldon: Well of course they\u2019re movies. Were you expecting me to come up with an example involving a real life time machine? That\u2019s absurd. ", "Scene: The stairwell. It is the previous day, and again Leonard and Sheldon are pulling the time machine up the stairs.", "Leonard: Come on, guys, push. ", "Howard (off): If I push any harder I\u2019m going to give birth to my colon. ", "Penny (coming out of her apartment): Oh, hey guys.", "Leonard (letting go of time machine, as does Sheldon): Uh, hi Penny. (Raj and Howard are heard to scream as the time machine slides back down the stairs.) Take a break, guys! ", "Penny: What are you doing?", "Leonard: Oh, just, you know, moving a\u2026 time machine. ", "Penny: Yeah, okay, neat, but I really got to get to work, so\u2026.", "Leonard: No problem. (Removes glasses, pulls down out of order tape from lift doors, and forces them open.) Hang on. (Takes Penny in his arms as he holds onto the lift cable.)", "Penny: But, what about your time machine.", "Leonard: Some things are more important than toys. (She puts her arms around his neck as he dangles from the cable.)", "Penny: Oh, I\u2019m scared. ", "Leonard: Don\u2019t worry baby, I\u2019ve got you.", "Penny: Oh, Leonard. (Kisses him as they descend from view. Leonard wakes up still sitting in the time machine.)", "Sheldon: It\u2019s still my turn.", "Scene: The living room. ", "Sheldon: What are you doing?", "Leonard: I\u2019m packing up all my collectibles and taking them down to the comic book store to sell. ", "Sheldon: Well is that really necessary. If you need money you can always sell blood. And semen. ", "Leonard: It\u2019s not about money.", "Raj (entering): We brought food.", "Howard: Lox and bagels, the breakfast of time travellers.", "Leonard: Terrific, does anyone want to buy my share of the time machine?", "Raj: Why?", "Leonard: Because I don\u2019t want it any more. ", "Howard: Why?", "Leonard: Just\u2026 personal reasons. ", "Sheldon: My spidey-sense tells me this has something to do with Penny. ", "Leonard: Look, do you want to buy me out or not?", "Raj: I\u2019ll give you a hundred dollars, which will make me half owner, and we\u2019ll put it on my balcony. ", "Howard: Screw his balcony, I\u2019ll give you a hundred and twenty and we\u2019ll put it in my garage. ", "Leonard: I paid two hundred dollars for my share.", "Raj: Dude, everyone knows a time machine loses half its value the minute you drive it off the lot.", "Sheldon: I\u2019ll go for two hundred, that time machine stays right where it is. ", "Raj: Three hundred, and I\u2019ll throw in my original 1979 Mattel Millenium Falcon with real light speed sound effects. ", "Leonard: No, no more toys or action figures or props or replicas or costumes or robots or Darth Vader voice changers, I\u2019m getting rid of all of it. ", "Howard: You can\u2019t do that, look what you\u2019ve created here, it\u2019s like nerdvana. ", "Raj: More importantly, you\u2019ve a Darth Vader voice changer? ", "Leonard: Not for long.", "Raj: Oh, I call dibs on the Golden Age Flash.", "Howard: Hang on, I need that to complete my Justice Society of America collection.", "Raj: Too bad, I called dibs.", "Howard: Well you can\u2019t just call dibs.", "Raj: I can and I did, look up dibs on Wikipedia.", "Sheldon: Dibs doesn\u2019t apply in a bidding war. ", "Leonard: It\u2019s not a bidding war, I\u2019m selling it all to Larry down at the comic book store. ", "Raj: Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs? ", "Howard: Will you forget dibs! ", "Leonard: He offered me a fair price for the whole collection.", "Sheldon: What\u2019s the number, I\u2019ll match it. ", "Raj: I\u2019ll match it, plus a thousand rupees. ", "Sheldon: What\u2019s the exchange rate.", "Raj: None of your business. Take it or leave it.", "Howard (on phone): Mom, my bar-mizvah bonds, how much do I got? Thanks. I can go twenty six hundred dollars and two trees in Israel. ", "Leonard: Forget it guys, if I sell to one of you, the other two are going to be really mad at me.", "Sheldon: Who cares, as long as you pick me. ", "Raj: Okay, Leonard, put down the box, let\u2019s talk.", "Leonard: Sorry Raj, my mind is made up.", "Sheldon (moving to block his path): No. I can\u2019t let you do this. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, get out of my way.", "Sheldon (brandishing toy sword from Leonard\u2019s box): None shall pass. ", "Leonard: Okay. I did not want to do this but, I have here the rare mint condition production error Star Trek: The Next Generation Geordi LaForge, without his visor in the original packaging. If you do not get out of my way, I will open it. ", "Howard: Okay man, be cool, we\u2019re all friends here. ", "Penny (coming out of her flat): What the hell\u2019s going on? ", "Sheldon: You hypocrite!", "Penny: What?", "Sheldon: Little Miss \u201cgrown ups don\u2019t play with toys\u201d. If I were to go into that apartment right now, would I find Beanie Babies? Are you not an accumulator of Care Bears and My Little Ponies? And who is that Japanese feline I see frolicking on your shorts? Hello,Hello Kitty! ", "Penny: Okay, okay look, if this is about yesterday, Leonard, I am really sorry about what I said, I was just a bit upset.", "Leonard: No, I needed to hear it.", "Penny: No you didn\u2019t. Look, you are a great guy, and it is things you love that make you who you are. ", "Howard: I guess that makes me large breasts. ", "Leonard: Still, I think it\u2019s time for me to get rid of this stuff and\u2026 you know\u2026 move on with my life. ", "Penny: Really?", "Leonard: Yeah.", "Penny: Oh. Wow. Good for you. (Kisses his cheek.)", "Leonard: Thanks. Hey, do you want to, I don\u2019t know, later\u2026", "Good looking man coming up stairs: Excuse me. Hey, Penny!", "Penny: Hi Mike.", "Mike: Are you ready to go. ", "Penny: Yeah, I just have to change.", "Mike: I\u2019ll give you a hand.", "Penny: Oh, stop it! Bye guys. ", "Leonard (after a long pause): My turn on the time machine. ", "Scene: A jungle. As the camera moves, the time machine becomes visible. Sheldon is sitting in it The disk stops spinning, and he looks around. The dials read APR 28 802,701. ", "Sheldon: It worked. It really worked. They said I was mad, but it worked. (Large hairy creatures with glowing eyes emerge from the forest and walk towards him menacingly.) Oh no, not Morlocks! Not flesh-eating Morlocks! He-e-e-e-e-e-e-elp! (With a yelp, he wakes up in the time machine in the living room.) ", "Leonard: Sheldon, are you okay? ", "Sheldon: We have to get rid of the time machine. ", "Leonard: It is a little big for the living room, isn\u2019t it?", "Sheldon: Yeah, that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s too big. ", "Leonard: I\u2019m glad you agree. I hired some guys to help us move it, come on in fellas. (A pair of Morlocks come through the door.)", "Sheldon: Oh no, Morlocks? Eat him, eat him. Aaaaargh. (Sheldon wakes up in his own bed.)
