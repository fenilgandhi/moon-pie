For Vulcans, mating, or, if you will, Pon Farr, it\u2019s an extremely private matter.", "Leonard: Still, I\u2019d like to know the details. His mother was human, his father was Vulcan, they couldn\u2019t just conceive.", "Howard: Maybe they had to go to a clinic. Imagine Spock\u2019s dad in a little room with a copy of pointy ears and shapely rears.", "Raj: How come on Star Trek everybody\u2019s private parts are the same. No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk, hey, get your thing out of my nose. ", "Penny (entering): Hi, can you help me, I was writing an email and the A key got stuck. Now it\u2019s just going \u201caaaaaaa\u201d.", "Leonard: What did you spill on it?", "Penny: Nothing. Diet coke. And yoghurt. A little nail polish. ", "Leonard: I\u2019ll take a look at it. ", "Howard: Gentlemen, switching to local nerd news. Fishman, Chen, Chowdry, McNair aren\u2019t fielding a team in the university physics bowl this year. ", "Leonard: You\u2019re kidding, why not?", "Howard: They formed a barbershop quartet, and got a gig playing Knotsbury Farm. ", "Penny: Wow, so in your world, you\u2019re like, the cool guys. ", "Howard: Recognise. ", "Leonard: This is our year! With those guys out, the entire physics bowl will kneel before Zod. ", "Penny: Zod?", "Howard: Kryptonian villain. Long story.", "Raj: Good story. (Clasps hands to mouth in shock.) ", "Sheldon: Well count me out.", "Howard: What? Why?", "Sheldon: You want me to use my intelligence in a tawdry competition? Would you ask Picasso to play Pictionary? Would you ask Noah Webster to play Boggle? Would you ask Jacques Cousteau to play Go Fish? ", "Leonard: Come on, you need a four person team, we\u2019re four people. ", "Sheldon: By that reasoning we should also play bridge, hold up a chuppah and enter the Olympic bobsled competition.", "Penny: I want tickets to that please. ", "Leonard: Sheldon, what, do I need to quote Spock\u2019s dying words to you.", "Sheldon: No, don\u2019t. ", "Leonard: The needs of the many.", "Howard: Outweigh the needs of the few. ", "Sheldon: Or the one. Dammit, I\u2019ll do it. ", "Credits sequence", "Scene: The cafeteria.", "Raj: Okay. First order of physics bowl business. We need a truly kick-ass team name. Suggestions.", "Howard: How about the perpetual motion squad? It\u2019s beyond the laws of physics, plus a little heads up for the ladies. ", "Leonard: The ladies?", "Howard: Perpetual motion squad, we can go all night.", "Raj: I like it.", "Sheldon: I don\u2019t. Teams are traditionally named after fierce creatures, thus intimidating ones opponent.", "Raj: Then we can be the Bengal Tigers.", "Sheldon: Poor choice. Gram for gram, no animal exceeds the relative fighting strength of the army ant. ", "Raj: Maybe so. But you can\u2019t incinerate a Bengal Tiger with a magnifying glass. ", "Leonard: Let\u2019s put it to a vote. All those in favour\u2026.", "Sheldon: Point of order. I move that any vote on team names should be unanimous. No man should be forced to emblazon his chest with the bengal tiger, when common sense dictates it should be an army ant. ", "Leonard: Will the gentleman from the great state of denial yield for a question? ", "Sheldon: I will yield.", "Leonard: After we go through the exercise of an annoying series of votes, all of which the gentleman will lose, does he then intend to threaten to quit if he does not get his way?", "Sheldon: He does. ", "Leonard: I move we are the Army Ants, all those in favour?", "Scene: The apartment.", "Penny: Good afternoon, and welcome to today\u2019s physics bowl practice round. I\u2019m Penny, and I\u2019ll be your host, because apparently I didn\u2019t have anything else to do on a Saturday afternoon, and isn\u2019t that just a little sad? Gentlemen, are you ready?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: Of course. ", "Howard: Fire away. (Raj puts his thumb up.)", "Penny: You know, it\u2019s none of my business, but isn\u2019t a guy who can\u2019t speak in front of women going to hold you back a little?", "Leonard: Oh, uh, he\u2019ll be okay once the women are mixed into the crowd. He only has a problem when they\u2019re one on one and smell nice.", "Penny: Oh, thanks Raj, it\u2019s vanilla oil.", "Leonard: I was actually the one who noticed, okay, let\u2019s just start. ", "Penny: Okay, the first question is on the topic of optics. What is the shortest light pulse ever produced? Dr Cooper.", "Sheldon: And of course, the answer is 130 adoseconds.", "Penny: That is correct.", "Leonard: I knew that too.", "Penny: Good for you, sweetie. Okay, next question. What is the quantum mechanical effect used to encode data on hard disk drives? Howard.", "Sheldon: And of course, the answer is giant magneto resistance.", "Penny: Right. ", "Howard: Hey, I buzzed in. ", "Sheldon: But I answered, it\u2019s called teamwork. ", "Howard: Don\u2019t you think I should answer the engineering questions? I am an engineer.", "Sheldon: By that logic I should answer all the anthropology questions because I\u2019m a mammal.\u00a0 ", "Leonard: Just ask another one.", "Penny: Okay. What artificial satellite has seen glimpses of Einsteins predicted frame dragging? (Raj buzzes.)", "Sheldon: And of course it\u2019s Gravity Probe B.", "Leonard: Sheldon, you have to let somebody else answer. ", "Sheldon: Why? ", "Penny: Because it\u2019s polite.", "Sheldon: What do manners have to do with it? This is war. Were the Romans polite when they salted the ground of Carthage to make sure nothing would ever grow again?", "Penny: Leonard, you said I only had to ask questions. ", "Sheldon: The objective of the competition is to give correct answers, if I know them, why shouldn\u2019t I give them? ", "Howard: Some of us might have the correct answers too. ", "Sheldon: Oh please, you don\u2019t even have a PhD. ", "Howard: Alright, that\u2019s it.", "Leonard: Howard, sit down.", "Howard: Okay. ", "Leonard: maybe we should take a little break.", "Sheldon: Good idea, I need my wrist brace, all this button pushing is aggravating my old Nintendo injury. ", "Howard (after Raj whispers in his ear): I agree.", "Penny: What did he say? ", "Howard: He compared Sheldon to a disposable feminine cleansing product one might use on a summer\u2019s eve. ", "Penny: Yeah, and the bag it came in. ", "Scene: The same, later. Sheldon is on his laptop. Leonard enters.", "Sheldon: Leonard, excellent, I want to show you something.", "Leonard: Can it wait, I need to talk to you.", "Sheldon: Just look. I\u2019ve designed the perfect uniforms for our team. The colours are based on Star Trek, the original series. The three of you will wear support red, and I will wear command gold. ", "Leonard: Why do they say AA? ", "Sheldon: Army Ants. ", "Leonard: Isn\u2019t that confusing? AA might mean something else to certain people. ", "Sheldon: Why would a physics bowl team be called anodised aluminium?", "Leonard: No, I meant\u2026. never mind. Hey, check it out. I got you a Batman cookie jar!", "Sheldon: Oh neat, what\u2019s the occasion?", "Leonard: Well, you\u2019re a friend, and you like Batman, and cookies, and you\u2019re off the team. ", "Sheldon: What?", "Leonard: Howard, Raj and I just had a team meeting. ", "Sheldon: No you didn\u2019t.", "Leonard: Yes we did, I just came from it.", "Sheldon: Okay, I don\u2019t know where you just came from, but it couldn\u2019t have been a team meeting because I\u2019m on the team and I wasn\u2019t there, ergo the team did not meet. ", "Leonard: Okay, let me try it this way, uh, I was at a coffee klatch with a couple of friends and one thing led to another and it turns out you\u2019re off the team. ", "Sheldon: Why?", "Leonard: Because you\u2019re taking all the fun out of it.", "Sheldon: Well, I\u2019m sorry, is the winner of the physics bowl the team that has the most fun?", "Leonard: Okay, let me try it this way, you\u2019re annoying and no-one wants to play with you any more. ", "Sheldon: I see. Well. At this point I should inform you that I intend to form my own team and destroy the molecular bonds that bind your very matter together, and reduce the resulting particulate chaos to tears.", "Leonard: Thanks for the heads up. ", "Sheldon: You\u2019re welcome. One more thing.", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: It\u2019s on, bitch. ", "Scene: The cafeteria. ", "Howard: So who\u2019d he get to be on his team.", "Leonard: He won\u2019t say. He just smiles, and eats macaroons out of his bat jar. ", "Raj: He\u2019s using psychological warfare. We must reply in kind. I say we wait until he looks at us, then laugh like, yes, you are a smart and strong competitor, but we are also smart and strong and we have a reasonable chance of defeating you. ", "Leonard: How exactly would that laugh go? ", "Raj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!", "Howard: That sounds more like, we are a tall thin woman who wants to make a coat out of your Dalmatians. ", "Leonard: Guys, let\u2019s remember that Sheldon is still our friend and my room mate.", "Howard: So?", "Leonard: So nothing, let\u2019s destroy him. ", "Sheldon (walking past): Gentlemen.", "Raj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!", "Howard: Okay, we\u2019re going to need a strong fourth for our team.", "Raj: You know who\u2019s apparently very smart, is the girl who played TV\u2019s Blossom. She got a PhD in neuroscience or something. ", "Leonard: Raj, we\u2019re not getting TV\u2019s Blossom to join our physics bowl team. ", "Raj: How about the girl from the Wonder Years? ", "Howard: Gentlemen, I believe I\u2019ve found the solution to all our problems. ", "Leonard: We can\u2019t ask Leslie Winkle.", "Raj: Why? Because you slept together and when she was done with you she discarded you like last night\u2019s chutney? ", "Leonard: Yes. ", "Howard: Sometimes you\u2019ve got to take one for the team.", "Raj: Yeah. Sack up, dude. ", "Leonard: Fine. Here I go, taking one for the team. In the sack. Hey Leslie.", "Leslie: Hi guys.", "Leonard: Leslie, I have a question for you, and it might be a little awkward, you know, given that I\u2026", "Howard: Hit that thang. ", "Leslie: Leonard, there\u2019s no reason to feel uncomfortable just because we\u2019ve seen each other\u2019s faces and naked bodies contorted in the sweet agony of coitus. ", "Leonard: There\u2019s not? Gee, cos it sure sounds like there should be. ", "Leslie: Rest assured that any aspects of our sexual relationship regarding your preferences, your idiosyncrasies, your performance, are still protected by the inherent confidentiality of the bedroom.", "Leonard: That\u2019s all very comforting, but if it\u2019s okay, I\u2019d like to get on with my question now.", "Leslie: Proceed.", "Leonard: We are entering the physics bowl and we need a fourth for our team.", "Leslie: No thanks, I\u2019m really busy with my like sign dilepton super symmetry search.", "Howard: Dilepton, schmilepton, we need you. ", "Leslie: Sorry. ", "Howard: Well, we tried. Just have to face Sheldon mano-e-mano-e-mano. A-mano. ", "Leslie: Wait, you\u2019re going up against Sheldon Cooper? ", "Howard: Yes.", "Leslie: That arrogant, misogynistic East-Texas doorknob that told me I should abandon my work with high energy particles for laundry and child bearing? ", "Leonard: She\u2019s in. ", "Scene: The Physics Bowl.", "Penny: So, how do you feel? Nice and loose? Come to play? Got your game face on? (The guys look confused.) Are you ready?", "Leonard: Oh, yeah. You know you don\u2019t have to stay for the whole thing. ", "Penny: Oh, no, no, I want to. It sounds really interesting. ", "Sheldon (entering in his Star Trek themed shirt): Gentlemen.", "Leonard: Sheldon.", "Howard: Sheldon. ", "Raj: Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.", "Penny: Sheldon. I\u2019m just going to sit down. ", "Leonard: So, is that your team.", "Sheldon: Actually, I don\u2019t need a team, I could easily defeat you single-handedly. But the rules require four, so may I introduce, the third floor janitor, he lady from the lunchroom, and, my Spanish is not good, either her son or her butcher. And what about your team? What rat have you recruited to the SS Sinking Ship?", "Leslie: Hello, Sheldon. ", "Sheldon: Leslie Winkle? ", "Leslie: Yeah, Leslie Winkle. The answer to the question, who made Sheldon Cooper cry like a little girl? ", "Sheldon: Yes, well, I\u2019m polymerised tree sap and you\u2019re non-organic adhesive so, whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.

Takes jacket off to reveal similar.) ", "Leslie: PMS? It\u2019s a couple of days early, but\u2026", "Leonard: No, it stands for Perpetual Motion Squad. ", "Leslie: Oh, right, of course, what was I thinking? ", "Gablehouser: Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to this year\u2019s physics bowl. Today\u2019s preliminary match features two great teams\u2026 AA versus PMS. ", "Howard: All night long, y\u2019all!

Alright, for ten points, what is the lightest element on earth with no stable isotope. (Buzz) AA?", "Sheldon: And of course, the answer is Technetium.", "Gablehouser: Terrific. Next question, what is the force between two uncharged plates due to quantum vacuum fluctuation. (Buzz) PMS?", "Raj: Sheldon can suck on, the Casimir Effect.", "Gablehouser: Correct.

Winning physics bowl. ", "Sheldon: How do you know anything about physics?", "Third Floor Janitor: Here I am janitor, in former Soviet Union I am physicist. Leningrad Politechnica. Go Polar Bears.
