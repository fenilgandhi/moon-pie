I feel like I should say something.", "Sheldon: You? No, you\u2019ll only make it worse.", "Penny: You want to know the most pathetic part? Even though I hate his lying, cheating guts, I still love him. Is that crazy?", "Sheldon: Yes. ", "Leonard: No, it\u2019s not crazy it\u2019s, uh, uh, it\u2019s a paradox. And paradoxes are part of nature, think about light. Now if you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as confirmed by the double slit experiments, but then, along comes Albert Einstein and discovers that light behaves like particles too.

It has been some time since we\u2019ve had a woman take her clothes off after which we didn\u2019t want to rip our eyes out.

Sure, you can ask me a favour, I would do you a favour for you.", "Penny: It\u2019s okay if you say no.", "Leonard: Oh, I\u2019ll probably say yes.", "Penny: It\u2019s just not the kind of thing you ask a guy you\u2019ve just met.", "Leonard: Wow.", "Scene: Leonard and Sheldon, Inside Leonard\u2019s car", "Sheldon: I really think we should examine the chain of causality here.", "Leonard: Must we?", "Sheldon: Event A. A beautiful woman stands naked in our shower. Event B. We drive half way across town to retrieve a television set from the aforementioned woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend.
