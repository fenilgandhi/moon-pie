You would have destroyed him in one location, and recreated him in another.", "Leonard: How about that. ", "Sheldon: Personally, I would never use a transporter. Because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon.", "Leonard: Would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon?

", "Leonard: Advantage Kim. ", "Gablehouser: I thought maybe you boys could show Dennis around, let him see why we\u2019re the best physics research facility in the country.", "Dennis: I already know you\u2019re not. You don\u2019t have an open science grid computer, or a free electron laser, and the string theory research being done here is nothing but a dead end.

We want him here boys, make it happen.", "Leonard: Yes sir. ", "Sheldon: You can count on us, we\u2019re on it. What the hell do you mean, dead end.

Alright, and this is my office.", "Dennis: Is this part of the tour? ", "Sheldon: Nope. Goodbye. ", "Leonard: Come on, Sheldon, we\u2019ve hardly shown him anything.", "Sheldon: Oh, alright, this is my desk, these are my books, this is my door, please close it behind you. Goodbye.

In Texas when a cow goes dry they don\u2019t keep feeding it, they just take her out and shoot her between the eyes. ", "Penny: I\u2019m confused, did Sheldon stop giving milk?

", "Sheldon: What exactly is it you do? I know you chatter on about it all the time, but I\u2019ve never really paid attention.", "Leonard: Okay, well, right now I\u2019m designing an experiment to study the soft component of cosmic radiation at sea-level, but I really don\u2019t need any help. ", "Sheldon: Oh, sure you do. Now, see, what\u2019s this here in the schematic, is that a laser array?", "Leonard: Yes.", "Sheldon: No. Hmmm. What happens if you use argon lasers instead of helium neon?", "Leonard: It would blow up.", "Sheldon: Are you sure? ", "Leonard: Pretty sure.", "Sheldon: Pretty sure\u2019s not very scientific, is this how you normally work, just hunches and guesses and stuff?", "Leonard: Okay, Sheldon, I understand that you\u2019re going through a bit of a career crisis, you\u2019re searching for some other area where you can feel valuable and productive but I need to tell you something and I want you to listen carefully.

So, what are we making today? ", "Howard: A small payload support structure for a European science experimental package that\u2019s going up on the next space shuttle.

But neither of those is a cogent argument for titanium over nanotubes. ", "Howard: Sheldon.", "Sheldon: Yes.", "Howard: Go away. ", "Sheldon: Did Leonard tell you to say that? ", "Howard: No, I thought of it all by myself. ", "Sheldon: Huh. It can\u2019t be a coincidence. There must be some causal link I\u2019m missing.", "Scene: Raj is exiting his office.", "Raj: Go away.

He watched me work for ten minutes, and then started to design a simple piece of software that could replace me. ", "Leonard: Is that even possible?", "Raj: As it turns out, yes.", "Howard: Something\u2019s got to be done about him, Leonard.", "Leonard: Like what? He\u2019ll never be able to cope with the fact that some fifteen year-old kid is smarter and more accomplished than he is. ", "Raj: Well, what if something were to happen to this boy so he was no longer a threat to Sheldon?", "Howard: Then our problem would be solved. ", "Leonard: Hang on, are we talking about murdering Dennis Kim? I\u2019m not saying no. ", "Howard: We don\u2019t have to go that far, there are other means available.", "Raj: We can\u2019t send him back to North Korea. He knows how to get out. ", "Howard: The only thing we need to do is make this Kim kid lose his focus.", "Leonard: That won\u2019t happen, he\u2019s not interested in anything but physics.", "Howard: What about biology? ", "Leonard: What?", "Howard: You know, biology? The one thing that can completely derail a world class mind.

Look, I\u2019ve decided that if the three of you drop whatever it is you\u2019re working on and join me, we could lick cold fusion in less than a decade, twelve years tops. (They stare at him.) Go away? (They nod) Hmm. Could it be me? ", "Scene: Outside Penny\u2019s apartment. ", "Penny (opening door): Oh, hey guys, what\u2019s up?", "Howard: We need a hot fifteen year-old Asian girl with a thing for smart guys.

Yeah, I think you\u2019ll appreciate this, very exciting.", "Gablehouser: Oh, what are you working on?", "Sheldon: Something remarkable. Since my prospects for the Nobel Prize in physics have disappeared, thank you very much, I\u2019ve decided to refocus my efforts and use my people skills to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Look, I\u2019m going to solve the Middle-East Crisis by building an exact replica of Jerusalem in the middle of the Mexican desert.

You can see the Matrix, can\u2019t you.", "Gablehouser: Okay, well, uh, obviously you\u2019re very busy with your\u2026 uh, um, come Dennis.

", "Sheldon: We could call it Nuevo Cherusalem. ", "Goldfarb: Please go away. ", "Sheldon: Said Pharoah to Moses. ", "Gablehouser: Why are all these young women here?", "Leonard: It\u2019s take your daughter to work day. ", "Gablehouser: Really, I was not aware of that. ", "Raj: Oh, yes. There was a very official email that was sent to everyone whose insurance files indicated they had daughters between the ages of 14 and 16. ", "Gablehouser: Hm?", "Howard: Smooth.", "Raj: Thank you. ", "Gablehouser: There\u2019s the man of the hour. ", "Leonard: Okay, so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age-appropriate women. ", "Howard: All he has to do now is hook up with one of them.

We can\u2019t get fifteen year-old girls drunk. \u00a0", "Howard: Or can we?", "Leonard: No, we can\u2019t. ", "Howard: I don\u2019t think you mean we can\u2019t. I think you mean we shouldn\u2019t.

If there was another wailing wall, exactly like the one in Jerusalem, but close to taco stands and cheap prescription drugs, would you still be able to wail at it? Okay, it\u2019s definitely me. ", "Leonard: Okay, we cannot leave this to chance, lets pick a girl, and figure out how to get her together with Dennis. ", "Raj: Okay. How about that one.", "Howard: Uh-uh. I know the type, cheerleader, student council, goes out with jocks, won\u2019t even look at anybody in the gifted programme. And if, after two years of begging, she does agree to go out with you, it turns out to be a set-up and you\u2019re in the back seat of your mom\u2019s car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you.", "Raj: Are you crying?", "Howard: No, I have allergies. ", "Raj: Okay, uh, how about her? ", "Leonard: Sure. If he wants to spend a couple of years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stupor with non-fat White Russians, while you\u2019re the one holding her head out of the toilet while she\u2019s puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you, and they she gets into Cornell because you wrote her essay for her, and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn\u2019t even know you. ", "Raj: Okay, so not her either. How about her?", "Howard: Interesting, kind of pretty, a little chubby so probably low self-esteem. ", "Leonard: I think that\u2019s our girl. One of us should go talk to her. ", "Raj: I can\u2019t talk to her, you do it. ", "Leonard: I can\u2019t just go up and talk to her. Howard, you talk to her. ", "Howard: Oh no, she\u2019ll never go for the kid once she gets a peek at this. ", "Raj: You know, if we were in India this would be simpler. Five minutes with her dad, twenty goats and a laptop and we\u2019d be done.", "Leonard: Well, we\u2019re not in India. ", "Raj: Alright, why don\u2019t we do it your way then? We\u2019ll arrange for this girl to move in across the hall from Dennis so he can pathetically moon over her for months on end.", "Leonard: Okay, that was uncalled for.", "Raj: You started it, dude. ", "Gablehouser: Could I have everyone\u2019s attention please. What a wonderful occasion this is. And how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day. We\u2019re here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family.", "Sheldon (sarcastically): Welcome Dennis Kim.

", "Gablehouser: Well, uh, well, uh\u2026.", "Leonard: The kid got a girl. ", "Raj: Unbelievable.", "Howard: Did anyone see how he did it?", "Sheldon (to Gablehouser): Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got this. Ladies and Gentlemen, honoured daughters. While Mr Kim, by virtue of his youth and naivety, has fallen prey to the inexplicable need for human contact, let me step in and assure you that my research will go on uninterrupted, and that social relationships will continue to baffle and repulse me. Thank you. ", "Howard: He\u2019s back.", "Leonard: Yeah, mission accomplished. ", "Raj: Forget the mission, how did that little yutz get a girl on his own?", "Howard: I guess times have changed since we were young. Smart is the new sexy. ", "Leonard: Well, why do we go home alone every night, we\u2019re still smart. ", "Raj: Maybe we\u2019re too smart. So smart it\u2019s offputting. ", "Howard: Yeah, let\u2019s go with that. ", "Scene: The park. The four guys are carrying remote control rockets.", "Howard: Unbelievable. Components I built are on the International Space Station, and I get a ticket for launching a model rocket in the park. ", "Leonard: I don\u2019t know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman \u201cyou have to frisk me, I have a rocket in my pants.\u201d", "Raj: Hey, look at that. (There is a group of youngsters on the grass, laying about. One is playing a guitar. Dennis Kim is among them. He is drinking something from a bottle in a brown paper bag.) It\u2019s Dennis Kim.", "Howard: Wow, I almost didn\u2019t recognise him.", "Raj: You know, I kind of feel bad about what we did to him.
